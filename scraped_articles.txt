As prosecutors near the home stretch of their criminal case against Donald Trump, one of the biggest questions looming over the historic trial is whether the former president will take the stand in his own defense.
Just last month, before jury selection began, Trump insisted he would be on the witness stand.
"I would testify, absolutely,” he said April 12 in response to a question from NBC News. “I’m testifying. I tell the truth, I mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there is no case.”
A week later, after the trial started, he told reporters at the courthouse in Manhattan that "yes" he will testify.
Since then, Trump has added caveats when asked the same question.
He told Newsmax two weeks ago that he'd testify "if necessary," and on Tuesday said during an interview with Spectrum News 1 Wisconsin that he will “probably” take the stand, adding that he “would like to.”
As a defendant in a criminal trial, Trump is under no obligation to testify.
"It's conventional wisdom among defense attorneys that there's a lot of risk to having your client testify, and the risks often outweigh the benefits," said Duncan Levin, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office who's now a criminal defense lawyer. But in this case, "traditional rules could be thrown out of the window."
"Nobody knows what he's going to do, including his own lawyers," Levin said of Trump. While his attorneys have likely advised him not to take the stand, Levin added, "he is an uncontrollable client who has a constitutional right to testify."
The judge presiding over the case, Juan Merchan, reminded Trump of that right in court last week, after the former president incorrectly told reporters that the gag order barring him from attacking witnesses and jurors meant "I'm not allowed to testify."
Merchan told Trump "you have an absolute right to testify at trial, if that is what you decide to do after consultation with your attorneys."
"It is a fundamental right that cannot be infringed upon," he said. He said the gag order only pertains to "statements that are made outside of court. It does not apply to statements made from the witness stand."
Arthur Aidala, a veteran New York lawyer whose clients have included Harvey Weinstein, said, "I have my best success when my clients do not take the stand," while adding that the jury would undoubtedly like to hear from Trump.
"Human instinct is people want to hear both sides. They want to see him take the stand and see what he can say," Aidala said.
Levin said there are matters Trump could testify to "that would be helpful to his case," including elements of the charges against him brought by the Manhattan DA. Trump is charged with falsifying business records related to reimbursing his then-lawyer Michael Cohen for a hush money payment to adult film actor Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 presidential campaign.
Prosecutors contend that Trump was trying to cover up an effort to improperly influence the election. He has pleaded not guilty and denied any wrongdoing.
Trump "could testify he did not intend for it to be about the election," and that he was in the dark about the records being falsified because he was preoccupied with other matters since he was president at the time he signed Cohen's checks, Levin said.
Aidala agreed, saying Trump could tell the jury, "I no longer had the luxury of time to keep track of these matters." But Trump would also "have to admit what he cannot deny," including that he signed Cohen's checks and that he knew what they were for.
If he were to testify, Trump would likely face days of cross-examination from prosecutors, who would "make him out to be a liar," and that affects any defendant, Aidala said.
The judge has already ruled that prosecutors can ask Trump questions about findings in recent civil cases that he violated gag orders and was found liable for defaming writer E. Jean Carroll and committing fraud.
Levin said Trump's testimony could be “a landmine” given the evidence against him so far. “It’s going to be nearly impossible to refute things," he said, adding that "a lie in a courtroom is a far more serious thing than a lie on the campaign trail."
"If the judge determines he lied on the stand, that would be the basis for a sentence increase" if Trump is convicted, Levin said.
Asked if political considerations could force Trump to take the stand to deny the allegations against him, Levin said he did not think so since Trump can make denials through the media and at his campaign rallies.
"He's better off when he’s not under oath and subject to cross-examination," Levin said.
In terms of advice on whether Trump should take the stand, Aidala said he'd wait to see how Cohen's testimony goes before making a recommendation. Cohen is expected to detail his private conversations with Trump about the hush money payment and the reimbursement, but Trump's team is expected to go after Cohen's credibility, including his admissions that he's previously lied under oath.
"Ultimately, it's Trump's decision," Aidala said.
Trump testified in his two most recent civil trials — the civil fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James’ office and the defamation case brought by Carroll.
His testimony in the Carroll matter was severely limited by the judge’s ruling in the case; it lasted only a few minutes.
In the fraud case, Trump testified when he was called as a witness by James’ office, and launched into repeated attacks on the attorney general and the judge. Trump was also listed as a defense witness in the case, but backed out of testifying the night before he was scheduled to take the stand.
“I have already testified to everything & have nothing more to say other than this is a complete & total election interference (Biden campaign!) witch hunt,” so “I will not be testifying,” Trump announced at the time on his social media platform, Truth Social.
The judge in that case, Arthur Engoron, found Trump liable for fraud and hit him and his company with a judgment that now totals over $450 million. In his ruling, Engoron said Trump’s testimony had not helped his case.
“Overall, Donald Trump rarely responded to the questions asked, and he frequently interjected long, irrelevant speeches on issues far beyond the scope of the trial. His refusal to answer the questions directly, or in some cases, at all, severely compromised his credibility,” the judge wrote.

WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and his allies beat back a dramatic effort by far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to oust him from power Wednesday, ending — for now — months of threats against his speakership.
The vote to "table" or kill Greene's motion to vacate the speaker's chair was 359-43. Just 10 Republicans voted with Greene, R-Ga.; seven Democrats voted present.
There were 196 Republicans and 163 Democrats who voted to kill Greene's motion; along with the 11 Republicans, 32 Democrats voted to move forward with her motion.
"I appreciate the show of confidence from my colleagues to defeat this misguided effort," Johnson said in Statuary Hall, just off the House floor, after the vote. "Hopefully, this is the end of the personality politics and the frivolous character assassination that has defined the 118th Congress. It’s regrettable. It’s not who we are as Americans, and we’re better than this. We need to get beyond it."
Greene, who had threatened for weeks to force the issue, dragged her feet as it became clear she didn't have enough support to remove Johnson. Unlike in last year's successful vote to remove former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., many Democrats had made it clear they would vote to save Johnson, especially after he helped stave off a government shutdown, pushed through the renewal of a critical intelligence surveillance spy tool and passed billions of dollars in foreign aid for Ukraine after months of delays.
During the last vote series of the week, Greene stood on the floor and announced she was filing a privileged motion to vacate the speaker's chair. Colleagues promptly booed her.
"This is the 'uniparty' for the American people watching," she said in response to the boos, pointing with both hands at Republicans and Democrats in the chamber.
Johnson's mentor and top ally, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., moved immediately to "table," or "kill,” Greene's motion. Johnson's GOP allies were in a strong position to beat back her efforts given that Democratic leaders said on April 30 that their rank-and-file members would help dismiss her motion.
“Amid this circus, House Democrats have been the adults in the room,” said Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., a moderate who is running for governor. “We have too much work to do to waste time on petty political games.”
That saves Johnson’s job at least temporarily, though the fact that Democrats voted to keep him in power is sure to infuriate conservative activists and outside groups. And nothing would prevent Greene or any other conservative foe from forcing another vote on his fate down the road.
The 10 Republicans who voted with Greene against tabling the motion were Warren Davidson of Ohio, Alex Mooney of West Virginia, Barry Moore of Alabama, Victoria Spartz of Indiana, Chip Roy of Texas, Eric Burlison of Missouri and Paul Gosar, Eli Crane and Andy Biggs, all of Arizona.
However, it isn’t clear all of them would have voted on a resolution to oust Johnson had the motion to table failed; Roy said he was undecided.
While Greene was passionate about toppling Johnson, her campaign never really gained momentum among her colleagues. Conservatives Massie and Gosar were the only co-sponsors of her resolution. And under normal circumstances, those three GOP votes would have been enough to depose Johnson given the GOP’s razor-thin majority if all Democrats voted to remove him.
But members of both parties are still smarting from the paralysis that took over the House for three weeks last fall after Johnson’s predecessor, McCarthy, became the first speaker to be ousted in the middle of a congressional term. Greene, a staunch McCarthy ally, vehemently opposed ousting him and ultimately voted no.
The idea of Democrats’ stepping in to save Johnson began bubbling up over the past several months, with members publicly and privately saying they would vote against Greene's effort in favor of governing.
In her resolution, and on the floor, Greene quoted Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., who said in a recent CBS “60 Minutes” interview: “Even though we’re in the minority, we effectively have been governing as if we were in the majority, because we continue to provide a majority of the votes necessary to get things done. Those are just the facts.”
Democrats cheered as she quoted their leader.
“Speaker Johnson’s tenure is defined by one self-serving characteristic," Greene said on the floor before the vote. "When given a choice between advancing Republican priorities or allied with the Democrats to preserve his own personal power, Johnson regularly chooses to ally himself with Democrats."
Although he signed on to Greene’s motion to vacate, Massie repeatedly said he didn’t want to force a vote to oust Johnson and cause similar chaos and instead pressed him to resign voluntarily.
Lawmakers, including many conservatives, have said they don’t want a repeat of the fall speaker fight. In an interview last weekend, Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley urged party unity when he was asked about Greene’s threat to force a vote to oust Johnson, arguing that the GOP wouldn’t be able to flip the Senate and expand its House majority if the party is divided.
“We need to make sure that all of the Republicans understand the gravity of this election cycle, and they do, and we need to make sure that we are on the same page as we’re moving forward,” Whatley said days before the vote.
Johnson allies lashed out at Greene as she filed her motion. Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., chair of the Republican Main Street Caucus and no relation to the speaker, ran to cameras on the steps of the Capitol to bash her.
“We know that this motion is not going to do one thing to make America stronger. It’s not going to do one thing to deliver a conservative victory,” he said. “She is engaged in a failing act of political theater. ... We’re going to do what adults do; we’re going to ignore the tantrums and instead work to actually govern this country.”
Asked whether Greene should be punished for her actions, moderate Rep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., said, "There should be accountability for those who continue to make this about themselves."
"Lies and dishonesty are a hell of a lot louder than truth and earnestness," he said. "I will leave to you to figure out which side of that equation she is on."
After the House voted to table, former President Donald Trump wrote on his social media platform that “I absolutely love Marjorie Taylor Greene” but said he prefers to see party unity, adding that “it is my request” that Republicans vote to table her motion.
In the end, Trump had no impact on the vote — it was already finished by the time he published his post.
While some Republicans called for retribution against Greene, including stripping her of committee assignments, Johnson sought out the colleague who tried to topple him. He was spotted at the end of Wednesday's vote series hurrying down the center aisle to catch up with Greene and Massie.
Johnson wrapped his arm around Massie and chatted with Greene for several minutes in the back of the chamber.
“I just talked with them about what they did and why and ... told them that was disappointing and regretful, but we move forward,” Johnson said.

The U.S. Department of Education is seeking to negotiate with the Carroll Independent School District in Southlake, Texas, over four students’ civil rights complaints — which three education law experts say signals that the department has substantiated the students’ allegations of racist and anti-LGBTQ discrimination.
The Education Department’s civil rights enforcement arm described the next steps in its investigation in a letter Monday to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents the students. The development comes three years after the civil rights organization filed federal complaints on behalf of students who said Carroll officials failed to protect them from harassment.
The four students, all of whom have either graduated or left the district, reported to the Education Department that they had been subjected to a barrage of racist and homophobic slurs and comments during their years at Carroll. One student said he suffered retaliation after reporting racial harassment to administrators. Another said he contemplated suicide after classmates repeatedly mocked him for his sexual orientation; his family said the district failed to address the bullying.
On Monday, the Education Department notified the NAACP Legal Defense Fund that it had contacted Carroll district officials to begin negotiating a resolution agreement in the four complaints — a step the agency takes only after finding that students’ civil rights have been violated, said Katrina Feldkamp, an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
The Southlake school system — which became the focus of national headlines in 2021 after conservative parents rejected a sweeping plan aimed at preventing discrimination — will now have 90 days to reach an agreement with the Education Department on steps it will take to address problems identified in the student complaints, experts said.
Angela Jones, a Black mother of a former Carroll student who was among those who complained to the Education Department, said she spent years advocating for changes to protect minority students in the affluent North Texas school district. But she was rebuffed by school board members and conservative parents who accused her and others of trying to force a far-left political ideology into classrooms. Jones said she and her family felt validated by the Education Department’s finding.
“They’re saying to the district, ‘You didn’t do it on your own, so we’re going to come in and make some recommendations for you to do it differently,’” Jones said. “I hope they’ll take it seriously, and re-evaluate and negotiate.”
A spokesperson for the Education Department said the agency doesn’t comment on pending cases. Carroll Superintendent Lane Ledbetter and the school board’s president, Cam Bryan, did not respond to messages requesting comment.
The local debate over how to address racism in Carroll schools became a national symbol of the battles over race, gender and sexuality that have swept the country and was featured in the 2021 NBC News podcast series “Southlake.”
The town’s fight began in 2018, after a viral video of white high school students chanting the N-word spurred dozens of Carroll parents and students to come forward with stories of discrimination. After the outcry, the school board appointed a committee of volunteers, including Jones, to come up with strategies to address the problem. The result of their work, the Cultural Competence Action Plan, called for mandatory diversity training for teachers and students and changes to the student handbook explicitly prohibiting harassment on the basis of race, gender and sexual orientation, among other changes. Then came the backlash.
After the plan was released in the summer of 2020, conservative parents and activists — outraged at what they depicted as anti-white and anti-American indoctrination — formed a political action committee called Southlake Families PAC, which promised to defeat the diversity plan and elevate “Judeo-Christian values” in the school district. They raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to support a slate of hard-line conservative candidates, launched attack ads accusing their opponents of being radical leftists and, in November 2021, won majority control of the Carroll school board.
Two weeks later, the Education Department opened its initial investigations into student complaints. The total number of civil right investigations at the district would eventually grow to eight. The status of the other four open cases is unclear.
The probes set the stage for a potential conflict between local voters who opposed the diversity plan and federal officials tasked with enforcing federal civil rights laws. Now that the Education Department has initiated the process to negotiate a resolution with the district in four of the complaints, the federal agency could end up requiring Carroll to implement some of the same types of diversity and inclusion programs that Southlake voters have rejected in landslide elections in recent years.
In a video address to the community after the investigations were announced in 2021, Ledbetter, Carroll’s superintendent, said the district would “absolutely comply” if the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) ordered changes. But some local activists have called on the district to fight back against what they see as federal overreach. They have spread unsubstantiated theories that the federal investigation was launched in retaliation against conservatives opposed to critical race theory.
U.S. Rep. Beth Van Duyne, a Republican whose district includes Southlake, wrote a letter in November 2021 to U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, co-signed by Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, expressing fears that the Biden administration was “weaponizing federal resources to intimidate parents who disagree with the policies of this administration.”
In a statement four months later, an Education Department spokesperson said the agency’s work is “in no way retaliatory and OCR serves as a neutral fact-finder with any complaint.”
In the years since gaining control of the school board, members backed by Southlake Families PAC have made changes that diversity advocates say have made the district less inclusive. The board voted in 2022 to eliminate language explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation and religion from the student handbook. And this week, the board adopted a resolution opposing the Biden administration’s decision to expand Title IX protections to LGBTQ students.
Ledbetter and members of the school board did not respond to a question from NBC News about whether it planned to work with the Education Department to reach a voluntary agreement.
W. Scott Lewis, managing partner at TNG, a consulting firm that advises school districts on complying with federal civil rights laws, said that if Carroll fails to reach a voluntary agreement with the Office for Civil Rights on how to address discrimination, the agency could impose changes that Carroll would have to abide by or risk losing federal funding or inviting an investigation by the Department of Justice.
Another approach that the district could take, Lewis said: Carroll could challenge the Education Department’s findings in court. “That’s not typically been very successful,” Lewis said.
Feldkamp, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorney, said her clients have asked the Education Department to require Carroll to implement many of the policies that were included in the Cultural Competence Action Plan, including mandatory diversity training for students and staff members.
“We need to send a message that we will not tolerate Black and brown students being pushed out of school, that it is unacceptable for racism and homophobia to win the day and that our public schools actually are supposed to be educational institutions where all students can feel supported and can thrive,” Feldkamp said.
On Wednesday, two community activist groups that had joined the civil rights complaints — the Southlake Anti-Racism Coalition and Cultural & Racial Equity for Every Dragon — sent a letter to Carroll officials calling on the district to agree “to remedies that will address the hostile environment” and “fulfill your responsibility to protect all students.”
Raven Rolle, a 23-year-old Black Carroll graduate and Southlake Anti-Racism Coalition member, said it shouldn’t have taken federal investigations for the district to listen to current and former students like herself who’ve shared stories of harassment.
“Hopefully it sets a precedent for the kids that are currently there and kids who will be there years from now that these things will never happen again, and if they do, they’ll be dealt with appropriately,” Rolle said.
Mia Mariani, a 19-year-old college student living in Pittsburgh, was among the former Carroll students notified this week that the Education Department was taking action in response to her complaint of anti-LGBTQ bullying at Carroll.
Mariani, whose story was detailed in the “Southlake” podcast, was bombarded by a torrent of vulgar messages from classmates on social media mocking her gender identity during a social studies class in the spring of 2022. After reporting the abuse, she secretly recorded her meeting with the principal, who argued that the boys who’d harassed her “were just wanting to debate” politics.  After her parents filed a complaint over the school’s handling of the situation, senior Carroll administrators investigated and concluded that Mariani’s complaint did “not satisfy the criteria necessary to constitute bullying.”
Now it appears the Department of Education has found evidence that her rights were violated.
Mariani said she was surprised when she got the news Monday. She’s worked to move on from her experiences in Southlake, she said, but hopes her case leads to changes for current and future students.
“Any change for them,” Mariani said, “is healing for me.”

The U.S. Department of Education is seeking to negotiate with the Carroll Independent School District in Southlake, Texas, over four students’ civil rights complaints — which three education law experts say signals that the department has substantiated the students’ allegations of racist and anti-LGBTQ discrimination.
The Education Department’s civil rights enforcement arm described the next steps in its investigation in a letter Monday to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which represents the students. The development comes three years after the civil rights organization filed federal complaints on behalf of students who said Carroll officials failed to protect them from harassment.
The four students, all of whom have either graduated or left the district, reported to the Education Department that they had been subjected to a barrage of racist and homophobic slurs and comments during their years at Carroll. One student said he suffered retaliation after reporting racial harassment to administrators. Another said he contemplated suicide after classmates repeatedly mocked him for his sexual orientation; his family said the district failed to address the bullying.
On Monday, the Education Department notified the NAACP Legal Defense Fund that it had contacted Carroll district officials to begin negotiating a resolution agreement in the four complaints — a step the agency takes only after finding that students’ civil rights have been violated, said Katrina Feldkamp, an attorney for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.
The Southlake school system — which became the focus of national headlines in 2021 after conservative parents rejected a sweeping plan aimed at preventing discrimination — will now have 90 days to reach an agreement with the Education Department on steps it will take to address problems identified in the student complaints, experts said.
Angela Jones, a Black mother of a former Carroll student who was among those who complained to the Education Department, said she spent years advocating for changes to protect minority students in the affluent North Texas school district. But she was rebuffed by school board members and conservative parents who accused her and others of trying to force a far-left political ideology into classrooms. Jones said she and her family felt validated by the Education Department’s finding.
“They’re saying to the district, ‘You didn’t do it on your own, so we’re going to come in and make some recommendations for you to do it differently,’” Jones said. “I hope they’ll take it seriously, and re-evaluate and negotiate.”
A spokesperson for the Education Department said the agency doesn’t comment on pending cases. Carroll Superintendent Lane Ledbetter and the school board’s president, Cam Bryan, did not respond to messages requesting comment.
The local debate over how to address racism in Carroll schools became a national symbol of the battles over race, gender and sexuality that have swept the country and was featured in the 2021 NBC News podcast series “Southlake.”
The town’s fight began in 2018, after a viral video of white high school students chanting the N-word spurred dozens of Carroll parents and students to come forward with stories of discrimination. After the outcry, the school board appointed a committee of volunteers, including Jones, to come up with strategies to address the problem. The result of their work, the Cultural Competence Action Plan, called for mandatory diversity training for teachers and students and changes to the student handbook explicitly prohibiting harassment on the basis of race, gender and sexual orientation, among other changes. Then came the backlash.
After the plan was released in the summer of 2020, conservative parents and activists — outraged at what they depicted as anti-white and anti-American indoctrination — formed a political action committee called Southlake Families PAC, which promised to defeat the diversity plan and elevate “Judeo-Christian values” in the school district. They raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to support a slate of hard-line conservative candidates, launched attack ads accusing their opponents of being radical leftists and, in November 2021, won majority control of the Carroll school board.
Two weeks later, the Education Department opened its initial investigations into student complaints. The total number of civil right investigations at the district would eventually grow to eight. The status of the other four open cases is unclear.
The probes set the stage for a potential conflict between local voters who opposed the diversity plan and federal officials tasked with enforcing federal civil rights laws. Now that the Education Department has initiated the process to negotiate a resolution with the district in four of the complaints, the federal agency could end up requiring Carroll to implement some of the same types of diversity and inclusion programs that Southlake voters have rejected in landslide elections in recent years.
In a video address to the community after the investigations were announced in 2021, Ledbetter, Carroll’s superintendent, said the district would “absolutely comply” if the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) ordered changes. But some local activists have called on the district to fight back against what they see as federal overreach. They have spread unsubstantiated theories that the federal investigation was launched in retaliation against conservatives opposed to critical race theory.
U.S. Rep. Beth Van Duyne, a Republican whose district includes Southlake, wrote a letter in November 2021 to U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona, co-signed by Republican Sens. Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, expressing fears that the Biden administration was “weaponizing federal resources to intimidate parents who disagree with the policies of this administration.”
In a statement four months later, an Education Department spokesperson said the agency’s work is “in no way retaliatory and OCR serves as a neutral fact-finder with any complaint.”
In the years since gaining control of the school board, members backed by Southlake Families PAC have made changes that diversity advocates say have made the district less inclusive. The board voted in 2022 to eliminate language explicitly prohibiting discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation and religion from the student handbook. And this week, the board adopted a resolution opposing the Biden administration’s decision to expand Title IX protections to LGBTQ students.
Ledbetter and members of the school board did not respond to a question from NBC News about whether it planned to work with the Education Department to reach a voluntary agreement.
W. Scott Lewis, managing partner at TNG, a consulting firm that advises school districts on complying with federal civil rights laws, said that if Carroll fails to reach a voluntary agreement with the Office for Civil Rights on how to address discrimination, the agency could impose changes that Carroll would have to abide by or risk losing federal funding or inviting an investigation by the Department of Justice.
Another approach that the district could take, Lewis said: Carroll could challenge the Education Department’s findings in court. “That’s not typically been very successful,” Lewis said.
Feldkamp, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund attorney, said her clients have asked the Education Department to require Carroll to implement many of the policies that were included in the Cultural Competence Action Plan, including mandatory diversity training for students and staff members.
“We need to send a message that we will not tolerate Black and brown students being pushed out of school, that it is unacceptable for racism and homophobia to win the day and that our public schools actually are supposed to be educational institutions where all students can feel supported and can thrive,” Feldkamp said.
On Wednesday, two community activist groups that had joined the civil rights complaints — the Southlake Anti-Racism Coalition and Cultural & Racial Equity for Every Dragon — sent a letter to Carroll officials calling on the district to agree “to remedies that will address the hostile environment” and “fulfill your responsibility to protect all students.”

The worried mother of a U.S. soldier in Russian custody said Wednesday that her son “was lured” there by a Russian woman he had been seeing in South Korea for over a year and that he’s being held on trumped-up charges of stealing roughly $100 from her.
Melody Jones said she thinks her son, Staff Sgt. Gordon Black, was set up by his girlfriend, whom she identified as Aleksandra Vashchuk.
“I think she convinced him to come there,” Jones said in a video interview from her home in Cheyenne, Wyoming. “He wanted to see her for the last time before going home, and so he went there.”
The Russians detained Black, 34, on theft charges last week after he traveled from the military base in South Korea where he had been stationed to the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok.
A Defense Department spokesperson said Tuesday that the Army is investigating whether Russia’s intelligence services specifically targeted Black.
“There is an administrative investigation underway to determine the facts and circumstances around his travel,” deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh said at a news conference Tuesday.
Black is an experienced soldier with 16 years of service who was supposed to be traveling to Fort Cavazos, Texas, to start a new assignment, the military said.
Asked why Black would risk traveling to a country where other Americans are being held against their will, Jones gave a one-word answer.
“Her,” she said. “He met her in the bar where she was working, and they’ve been together, on and off, for about a year and a half. I’ve never met her in person, but I’ve spoken to her over Messenger. My motherly instincts told me something was wrong with her.”
Jones said her son, who is in the midst of a divorce, “is a good boy with a cute, crooked smile.”
“He was a good soldier, too,” and he speaks fluent Russian, she said.
But Vashchuk had some kind of hold over him, she said.
“I was talking about it with my husband, and we don’t know what it is,” Jones said. “Why would she latch on to him?”
On Tuesday, Radio Free Europe found what it says is the TikTok account of a woman who posted several videos of her apparently with Black in South Korea in 2022 and 2023. The woman said in the videos that she lived in South Korea for five years.
Jones said that woman appeared to be Vashchuk.
The Russian Foreign Affairs Ministry office in Vladivostok has said Black’s detention had nothing to do with politics or espionage.
Black didn’t have Defense Department clearance to visit Russia, nor is there any indication that he planned to stay there, Army spokesperson Cynthia O. Smith said earlier Tuesday.
“Instead of returning to the continental United States, Black flew from Incheon, Republic of Korea through China to Vladivostok, Russia, for personal reasons,” Smith said in a statement.
When Black landed in Vladivostok, he was charged with “secretly stealing property” of a person referred to as “citizen T” and ordered held until at least July 2, Pervomaisky District Court spokeswoman Elena Oleneva said in a statement Tuesday.
The court confirmed that Black would be held for at least two months.
Jones said her son told her he was in civilian clothing when he was pulled off the plane and interrogated for several hours.
Black, who grew up in a small town in southern Illinois, enlisted in the Army as an infantryman in 2008, Smith said. From October 2009 through September 2010, he served in Iraq, Smith said. He also served in Afghanistan from June 2013 until March 2014.
Most recently, Smith said, Black was assigned to the Eighth Army and based at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas U.S. military installation in the world.
On April 10, Black was “out-processed” and given two weeks to get to Texas, Smith said.
Current travel guidance from the State Department advises against all travel to Russia.
Jones said her son told her he planned to stop in Vladivostok before he flew to Texas.
“I was worried about him going, because the government there has been grabbing Americans,” she said.
The captive Americans include Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who was jailed in March 2023, and former Marine Paul Whelan, who was arrested in 2018.
“I told him not to go,” Jones said. “I was more worried about him going to Russia than I was when he was in Iraq and Afghanistan.”
Jones said her son texted her after he was detained.
“The last thing I got from his was ‘Don’t worry about me, I’m OK,’” she said.
Jones said her son listed her as his emergency contact and that’s why she got the call from the State Department on Thursday that he had been arrested by the Russians. She said that she hasn’t heard from anybody since then and that she’s not sure whether his wife has been in touch with the military.
“They have a 6½-year-old daughter,” Jones said. “And she misses her daddy.”
Jones said Black isn’t her only son. She has two others, as well as a daughter. So she won’t be alone on Mother’s Day.
“Gordon used to call me at least once a week,” she said. “And he usually sends me flowers on Mother’s Day. The last time it was two dozen red roses. But I guess not this year.”

An Air Force airman who was fatally shot at his Okaloosa County, Florida, apartment Friday was killed by a deputy after law enforcement burst into the wrong home, civil rights attorney Ben Crump said Wednesday.
A woman said she was on a FaceTime video call with Senior Airman Roger Fortson, 23, when he was killed and that he was alone and there was no disturbance, which law enforcement said was the reason for the call, Crump said.
The Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office said that Friday afternoon, “our deputy responded to a call of a disturbance in progress where he encountered an armed man,” and the deputy shot him.
According to the woman on the FaceTime call, whom Crump did not identify, Fortson heard a knock at his door, asked “who is it?” and got no response, and could not see anyone through the peephole, Crump said in a statement.
There was a second, aggressive knock, Crump said, citing the woman’s account.
“Concerned, he did what any other law-abiding citizen would do and retrieved his legally-owned gun, but as he was walking back to the living room, police burst through the door. When they saw the gun, they shot Roger six times,” Crump said in the statement.
"The witness has said that she saw Roger on the ground stating, 'I can’t breathe,' after he was shot," Crump said. “She has also said the police were in the wrong apartment as there was no disturbance in the apartment and he was alone."
A spokesperson for the sheriff’s office Friday night did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the claim that police were at the wrong apartment.
The Florida Department of Law Enforcement said it is investigating the shooting at the request of the sheriff's department. It did not provide any additional information, citing the active investigation.
The state attorney's office is also conducting an independent review, the sheriff’s office said.
Sheriff Eric Aden said in a statement that “all of us at the Okaloosa County Sheriff’s Office are saddened about the fatal officer involved shooting over the weekend.”
“At this time, we humbly ask for our community’s patience as we work to understand the facts that resulted in this tragic event,” he said.
Hurlburt Field, the Air Force base where Fortson was assigned, said in a statement that Fortson entered active duty on Nov. 19, 2019. He was assigned to the 4th Special Operations Squadron.
“The 1st Special Operations Wing’s priorities are providing casualty affairs service to the family, supporting the squadron during this tragic time, and ensuring resources are available for all who are impacted,” the base said in a statement.
Okaloosa County is in the Florida Panhandle, east of Pensacola.

WASHINGTON — A right-wing social media influencer hired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign who previously said Jan. 6 was “Democrat misdirection” appears to have himself been on the restricted grounds of the U.S. Capitol during the attack.
NBC News first reported that Kennedy’s campaign hired Zach Henry’s firm, Total Virality, for “influencer engagement” in March. Henry had worked as deputy communications director for Republican Vivek Ramaswamy’s presidential campaign, as well as for Blake Masters during his Senate run in Arizona.
Henry, as NBC News reported, had posted that Jan. 6 was “no MAGA insurrection Just more Democrat misdirection” and appears to have embraced conspiracy theories about the Capitol attack, including posting that “antifa” was behind it, which is false.
But photos and videos uncovered by NBC News and online “sedition hunters,” who have aided the FBI in hundreds of cases against Capitol rioters, appear to show Henry among the mob outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, beyond the previously established police lines, although it is unclear whether any of the barricades and “restricted” signs remained by the time he arrived.
There is no indication that Henry entered the Capitol or that he engaged in assaults on police officers or in destruction of property. Federal prosecutors have almost entirely focused their resources on Jan. 6 participants who either went inside the building or committed violence or destruction outside it, so there is little chance that Henry would be charged; the few nonviolent Jan. 6 defendants who were charged solely for going on restricted Capitol grounds were generally charged with misdemeanors.
But Henry's presence on Capitol grounds would be significant given his previous social media posts about Jan. 6 and his new position on Kennedy’s campaign as Kennedy runs for president as an independent against former President Donald Trump.
Henry acknowledged in a phone call that he was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, but declined to discuss his precise location. “I was in D.C. on January 6, but I’m not going to confirm where I was on the day or, you know, how close I got to the Capitol,” he said.
Henry asked to see images of himself outside the Capitol before he would comment further, and NBC News provided him with screenshots. He stopped responding to further messages or phone calls.
Kennedy's campaign also did not respond to a request for comment.
Henry was the communications director for the Arizona Republican Party from 2019 until late January 2021 and appears to have been behind the party’s official Twitter account, including when it posted tweets in early December 2020 asking followers whether they were ready to give up their lives to keep Trump in office, reposting a tweet by “Stop the Steal” organizer Ali Alexander. Henry largely defended those @AZGOP tweets in response to media coverage at the time, saying in a statement that the party “condemns all forms of violence in the strongest terms”; though he did not say who posted them.
Days later, when another Twitter user called the person running the @AZGOP account “one of the funniest posters in the state,” Henry retweeted it from his personal account, adding: “No comment.”
On Dec. 14, 2020, the @AZGOP account posted a video titled “The Signing,” featuring then-party chairwoman Kelli Ward and other Arizona “fake electors” signing paperwork falsely saying Trump won Arizona, which was sent to Congress and the National Archives. A state grand jury recently indicted Ward and other fake electors, as well as Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, in relation to the alleged scheme. It is unclear whether Henry himself posted the video of the signing event, which took place at Arizona Republican Party headquarters and is mentioned in the indictment.
On Jan. 6, 2021, Henry appeared to be posting to the @AZGOP accounts, this time from Washington. The account posted an image of Raheem Kassam, a far-right influencer who posted misinformation in the aftermath of Trump’s election loss. Kassam was livestreaming at the time the photo was taken, and a man whom online sleuths identified as Henry by running known images of Henry against a database of videos from Jan. 6 is seen on Kassam’s livestream talking about the @AZGOP account. Kassam encouraged his followers to follow the account, which he called “spicy.” The man the sleuths identified as Henry was wearing a brown hoodie that matches one Henry wore in a photo posted to his own Facebook account a few years earlier.
Later, the man identified as Henry was captured in photos and on video on the restricted grounds of the Capitol. That night, the @AZGOP account posted video from the restricted grounds of the Capitol and also posted video that shows the mob taking over the inauguration platform and using police barricades to climb a staircase leading to the place where the Capitol was first breached. Online investigators found another open-source video that shows the man identified as Henry recording the same moment that was posted to the @AZGOP account.
The video posted by the AZGOP account syncs up with the third-party video of the man who appears to be Henry: First he pans slowly to the right, then abruptly to the left, and then he does a clockwise 360-degree spin.
Sleuths also identified Capitol surveillance video, previously released in connection with a Jan. 6 case, that features the same man. Other open-source videos show the man identified as Henry still wearing the brown hoodie and an American flag mask leaving the Capitol grounds.
In the early days of the Jan. 6 investigation, federal prosecutors charged a handful of nonviolent defendants who were on the grounds of the Capitol but never entered the building. That is no longer a focus for prosecutors; hundreds of people who entered the building have still not been charged.
“We have used our prosecutorial discretion to primarily focus on those who entered the building, on those who engaged in violent or corrupt conduct on Capitol grounds,” U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves said this year. “But if a person knowingly entered a restricted area without authorization, they had already committed a federal crime. Make no mistake, thousands of people occupied an area that they were not authorized to be present in in the first place.
Henry posted that he had left the Arizona GOP job on Jan. 23, 2021, just days after Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president, passing through the lower west tunnel where pro-Trump rioters had viciously assaulted officers just days earlier.
In 2022 he posted on his own account a shortened version of the video that was originally posted by @AZGOP. The post echoed the conspiracy theory that “antifa” was behind the pro-Trump mob’s attack.

WASHINGTON — A right-wing social media influencer hired by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s presidential campaign who previously said Jan. 6 was “Democrat misdirection” appears to have himself been on the restricted grounds of the U.S. Capitol during the attack.
NBC News first reported that Kennedy’s campaign hired Zach Henry’s firm, Total Virality, for “influencer engagement” in March. Henry had worked as deputy communications director for Republican Vivek Ramaswamy’s presidential campaign, as well as for Blake Masters during his Senate run in Arizona.
Henry, as NBC News reported, had posted that Jan. 6 was “no MAGA insurrection Just more Democrat misdirection” and appears to have embraced conspiracy theories about the Capitol attack, including posting that “antifa” was behind it, which is false.
But photos and videos uncovered by NBC News and online “sedition hunters,” who have aided the FBI in hundreds of cases against Capitol rioters, appear to show Henry among the mob outside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, beyond the previously established police lines, although it is unclear whether any of the barricades and “restricted” signs remained by the time he arrived.
There is no indication that Henry entered the Capitol or that he engaged in assaults on police officers or in destruction of property. Federal prosecutors have almost entirely focused their resources on Jan. 6 participants who either went inside the building or committed violence or destruction outside it, so there is little chance that Henry would be charged; the few nonviolent Jan. 6 defendants who were charged solely for going on restricted Capitol grounds were generally charged with misdemeanors.
But Henry's presence on Capitol grounds would be significant given his previous social media posts about Jan. 6 and his new position on Kennedy’s campaign as Kennedy runs for president as an independent against former President Donald Trump.
Henry acknowledged in a phone call that he was in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021, but declined to discuss his precise location. “I was in D.C. on January 6, but I’m not going to confirm where I was on the day or, you know, how close I got to the Capitol,” he said.
Henry asked to see images of himself outside the Capitol before he would comment further, and NBC News provided him with screenshots. He stopped responding to further messages or phone calls.
Kennedy's campaign also did not respond to a request for comment.
Henry was the communications director for the Arizona Republican Party from 2019 until late January 2021 and appears to have been behind the party’s official Twitter account, including when it posted tweets in early December 2020 asking followers whether they were ready to give up their lives to keep Trump in office, reposting a tweet by “Stop the Steal” organizer Ali Alexander. Henry largely defended those @AZGOP tweets in response to media coverage at the time, saying in a statement that the party “condemns all forms of violence in the strongest terms”; though he did not say who posted them.
Days later, when another Twitter user called the person running the @AZGOP account “one of the funniest posters in the state,” Henry retweeted it from his personal account, adding: “No comment.”
On Dec. 14, 2020, the @AZGOP account posted a video titled “The Signing,” featuring then-party chairwoman Kelli Ward and other Arizona “fake electors” signing paperwork falsely saying Trump won Arizona, which was sent to Congress and the National Archives. A state grand jury recently indicted Ward and other fake electors, as well as Rudy Giuliani and Mark Meadows, in relation to the alleged scheme. It is unclear whether Henry himself posted the video of the signing event, which took place at Arizona Republican Party headquarters and is mentioned in the indictment.
On Jan. 6, 2021, Henry appeared to be posting to the @AZGOP accounts, this time from Washington. The account posted an image of Raheem Kassam, a far-right influencer who posted misinformation in the aftermath of Trump’s election loss. Kassam was livestreaming at the time the photo was taken, and a man whom online sleuths identified as Henry by running known images of Henry against a database of videos from Jan. 6 is seen on Kassam’s livestream talking about the @AZGOP account. Kassam encouraged his followers to follow the account, which he called “spicy.” The man the sleuths identified as Henry was wearing a brown hoodie that matches one Henry wore in a photo posted to his own Facebook account a few years earlier.
Later, the man identified as Henry was captured in photos and on video on the restricted grounds of the Capitol. That night, the @AZGOP account posted video from the restricted grounds of the Capitol and also posted video that shows the mob taking over the inauguration platform and using police barricades to climb a staircase leading to the place where the Capitol was first breached. Online investigators found another open-source video that shows the man identified as Henry recording the same moment that was posted to the @AZGOP account.
The video posted by the AZGOP account syncs up with the third-party video of the man who appears to be Henry: First he pans slowly to the right, then abruptly to the left, and then he does a clockwise 360-degree spin.
Sleuths also identified Capitol surveillance video, previously released in connection with a Jan. 6 case, that features the same man. Other open-source videos show the man identified as Henry still wearing the brown hoodie and an American flag mask leaving the Capitol grounds.
In the early days of the Jan. 6 investigation, federal prosecutors charged a handful of nonviolent defendants who were on the grounds of the Capitol but never entered the building. That is no longer a focus for prosecutors; hundreds of people who entered the building have still not been charged.
“We have used our prosecutorial discretion to primarily focus on those who entered the building, on those who engaged in violent or corrupt conduct on Capitol grounds,” U.S. Attorney Matthew Graves said this year. “But if a person knowingly entered a restricted area without authorization, they had already committed a federal crime. Make no mistake, thousands of people occupied an area that they were not authorized to be present in in the first place.
Henry posted that he had left the Arizona GOP job on Jan. 23, 2021, just days after Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th president, passing through the lower west tunnel where pro-Trump rioters had viciously assaulted officers just days earlier.
In 2022 he posted on his own account a shortened version of the video that was originally posted by @AZGOP. The post echoed the conspiracy theory that “antifa” was behind the pro-Trump mob’s attack.

The bundle is back.
Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery are planning to offer their streaming services — Disney+, Hulu and Max — in a bundle mirroring the traditional cable TV package, the companies said Wednesday.
The latest iteration of the bundle, which will be available this summer, will be offered on both the ad-supported and commercial-free tiers. Pricing has yet to be disclosed, but the option will be offered at a discount, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Disney will essentially act as the distributor in this case, collecting subscription fees from subscribers and paying out Warner Bros. Discovery a percentage, the person added.
This mash up of Max, Disney+ and Hulu will give streaming subscribers access to a wide breadth of content from the cable TV bundle. It’ll include broadcast networks ABC and Fox (Fox, which doesn’t have its own entertainment streaming subscription service, licenses it content on Hulu) as well as from cable networks including TNT, TBS, CNN, Discovery Channel, Food Network, Disney Channel and more.
The offering, reminiscent of the traditional cable TV bundle that has been upended in recent years and continues to bleed customers at a fast clip, is the latest partnership between the two media giants in recent months.
Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney’s ESPN, along with Fox Corp., have also joined forces to offer a sports streaming service, which is expected to launch this fall.
Earlier on Wednesday, Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch said on an earnings call he thought the sports streaming venture would likely be bundled with other entertainment streaming services.
Disney has been offering its streaming services — Disney+, Hulu and ESPN+ — as a bundle for sometime. ESPN+ will still coexist with the sports streaming venture, but is not included in the Warner Bros. Discovery and Disney bundle. Hulu content has also been recently integrated into the Disney+ platform, though they still require separate subscriptions.
Max costs $9.99 a month with ads, or $15.99 without. Disney+’s basic tier with ads costs $7.99 per month — or bundled with Hulu, $9.99 a month — while its premium plan is $13.99 per month, or $19.99 with Hulu. Meanwhile, Hulu on its own costs $7.99 with ads, or $17.99 ad-free.

Nearly 90% of adults over age 20 in the United States are at risk of developing heart disease, an alarming new study suggests.
While the unexpectedly high number doesn't mean that the majority of adults in the U.S. have full-blown heart disease, it does indicate that many are at risk of developing the condition, even younger people.
Researchers identified people at high risk using a recently defined syndrome that takes into account the strong links between heart disease, obesity, diabetes and kidney disease, according to the research published Wednesday in JAMA.
The American Heart Association alerted doctors in October about cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, a condition which affects major organs in the body, including the brain, heart, liver and kidneys. CKM is diagnosed in stages ranging from zero — no risk factors for heart disease — to 4 — people with diagnosed heart disease plus excess body fat, metabolic risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes, or kidney disease.
For the new study, researchers analyzed almost a decade’s worth of data from more than 10,000 people who were participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
“We absolutely were surprised that almost 90% of people met the criteria,” said study co-author Dr. Rahul Aggarwal, a cardiology fellow at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, in Boston. “It was much higher than we anticipated in a database that included younger adults.”
Especially concerning was the finding that almost 50% of the NHANES participants were at stage 2 of CKM, meaning that they were at moderate risk because they had either high blood sugar, hypertension, high cholesterol or chronic kidney disease, Aggarwal said.
Just more than a quarter of the group — people listed as stage 1 — were at increased risk of developing heart disease because of being obese or overweight, having excess belly fat and fat around their organs, but didn't have specific symptoms.
The researchers found that 15% of the participants had advanced disease, a number that remained fairly constant between 2011 and 2020.
“I think one of the biggest factors contributing to the fact that the percentage of people in advanced stages is not improving is obesity, which is very prevalent in the U.S.,” Aggarwal said, adding that 40% of people in America are obese. Another 32% are overweight based on body mass index calculations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Carrying excess pounds increases the likelihood a person will have high blood pressure, high blood sugar and high cholesterol, although some have metabolic risk factors even if they are at a healthy weight.
Participants older than 65 were more likely to be at an advanced stage than people between 45 to 64. But being young wasn’t as protective as one might assume. Only 18% of people ages 20 through 44 were at stage zero. That is, they had no risk factors.
The new findings show that health care providers need to be picking up on these conditions earlier “before they lead to downstream effects,” such as increased risk of heart attack, heart failure and stroke, Aggarwal said. “We need to diagnose earlier and be more aggressive at treating people.”
Adopting lifestyle changes, such as improved diets and increased activity, can help protect against heart attack and stroke.
The findings also show that “young adults, those younger than 45, are not as healthy as we thought they were,” Aggarwal said.
Experts were also surprised by the high rates of CKM.
“It is alarming that 90% of the population is at least stage 1 and only 10% have no risk factors,” said Dr. Sripal Bangalore, a professor of medicine and director of invasive and interventional cardiology at NYU Langone Health in New York City.
He blames the epidemic of overweight and obesity for those numbers.
“We have a lot of work to do to reduce the rates of overweight and obesity,” Bangalore said. “If we can do that, then hopefully we can reduce the number of people who progress to stage 2 and also move the needle down for higher stages.”
The inclusion of kidney disease in the risk assessments for cardiovascular disease makes a lot of sense, said Dr. Adriana Hung, a kidney specialist and epidemiologist and a professor of medicine at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee.
“Kidney disease magnifies cardiovascular disease,” she said. “Some studies show that a patient has as much as six times the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease if kidney disease is also present.”
The new, broader approach to heart disease is likely to help identify more people who are at risk, said Dr. Robert Rosenson, director of lipids and metabolism for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York City.
“The main message from this study should be that many common behaviors are leading to an accumulation of diseases over one’s lifetime, which will impact quality of life and survival,” he said.
The large numbers of people with CKM in this study are related to overweight and obesity, insulin resistance and a diet that is high in fat and salt, Rosenson added.
People need to realize that it’s not just the heart that is being harmed by unhealthy diets and lack of exercise, he said, but that lifestyle factors also have an effect on cognition.

Four flight attendants abused “their privileges as airline employees” and smuggled “millions of dollars of drug money” out of New York City to the Dominican Republic, federal authorities said Wednesday.
The suspects had access to the "Known Crewmember (KCM)" lane at John F. Kennedy International Airport, giving them fast and X-ray-free passage through security, authorities said.
"In effect, given these loosened security procedures, KCM privileges allow flight attendants to bypass airport security with large quantities of cash without that cash being seized," a Homeland Security Investigations special agent wrote in a complaint.
Charlie Hernandez, 42; Sarah Valerio Pujols, 24; Emmanuel Torres, 34; and Jarol Fabio, 35, all face various charges connected to "unlicensed money transmission," prosecutors said. They were arrested Tuesday, a Homeland Security Investigations spokesperson said.
Hernandez lives in West New York, New Jersey, while the other three defendants live in New York City, officials said.
They are accused of smuggling about $8 million in total in "bulk cash" to the Dominican Republic, prosecutors said.
"As alleged, these flight attendants smuggled millions of dollars of drug money and law enforcement funds that they thought was drug money from the United States to the Dominican Republic over many years by abusing their privileges as airline employees," U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said in a statement.
An informant gave Hernandez $121,215 — funds "derived from narcotics trafficking" — and he then gave Pujols $61,215 of it for them to take to the Dominican Republic in December 2019, according to the complaint.
Torres is accused of smuggling at least $1.5 million in drug money to the Dominican Republic from 2015 to 2022, the complaint says. Fabio sneaked out $1.5 million from 2015 to 2023, federal authorities alleged.
Delta Airlines confirmed that two of the defendants work for it.
“Delta has cooperated fully with law enforcement in this investigation and will continue to do so," it said in a statement.
An attorney for Pujols said her client is no longer in custody but would not comment further.
A lawyer for Fabio could not immediately be reached for comment Wednesday. No attorneys were immediately listed in court records for Hernandez and Torres.

South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a top contender to be former President Donald Trump’s running mate, refused to say in a recent interview whether former Vice President Mike Pence acted appropriately when he certified the 2020 presidential election.
Noem was asked whether she thinks Pence did the right thing by overseeing the certification process in Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, when he rebuffed pressure from Trump to reject the results.
"That situation will never happen again, because the law has been changed. So I don't answer hypothetical questions," Noem said Monday on NewsNation’s “Elizabeth Vargas Reports.”
"Looking back that day, I wasn't in the situation. I wasn't — didn't have the information he had," she said, doubling down on a similar response she gave to CNN when she also said Pence has "failed Donald Trump since that day."
A spokesperson for Noem did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday evening.
Noem, who is in her second term, made her comments this week about Pence amid a rough stretch for her as she promotes her new book, “No Going Back,” a mix of autobiographical details and policy proposals.
Noem has faced bipartisan backlash over certain passages in the book, including one in which she describes killing her young dog and another in which she says she met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Noem said Monday that the anecdote about Kim should not have appeared in the book, though she has refused to say in interviews whether she met with him. Her publisher confirmed this week that the passage would be removed.
Noem also criticized Pence in the interview for not backing Trump in this year’s election.
“I wish Mike Pence would endorse President Trump. That’s what’s frustrating for me right now,” she said.
Pence, who dropped out of the GOP primary campaign in October, said in March that he would not endorse Trump. He told Fox News at the time that “there were profound differences between me and President Trump on a range of issues, and not just our difference on my constitutional duties that I exercised on January 6th.”

Netflix’s “The Roast of Tom Brady” had viewers doubled over in laughter. It also got Jason Kelce and his brother, Travis Kelce, thinking about who they would want to roast them if the opportunity presented itself.
“If I was picking who to roast me, I would pick people that like I would have no problem getting into a fistfight with, like family members,” Jason Kelce said on the May 8 episode of their “New Heights” podcast.
However, he drew the line at one person very close to him — his wife, Kylie Kelce.
“The one person I wouldn’t allow on the stage is Kylie because she knows way too much,” he said. “Cannot allow that.”
“I mean, every day I’m getting roasted by Kylie. I don’t need her to go up on stage and do that,” he added.
Travis Kelce, meanwhile, had a list of people that’d he be more than willing to fire zingers at him.
“Well, Santino’s one of my favorite comedians of all time and I think he would f------ deliver,” he said, possibly referring to Andrew Santino, who recently appeared on “New Heights.”
“Dave Chappelle is the all-time great. Kevin Hart. I would love Kevin to go up there and just f------ rip me in half,” Travis Kelce continued before praising Hart for the work he did on Brady’s roast.
He also mentioned Nikki Glaser, who drew raves for her performance at Brady’s roast.
“Nikki Glaser’s f------ hilarious. If I did a roast, you would have to get Nikki up there,” Travis Kelce said.
Travis Kelce also singled out well-known roaster Jeff Ross, who had one joke at the roast that viewers speculated might have rubbed Brady the wrong way.
“I met Jeff Ross out in L.A. at one of the Comedy Stores out there,” he said. “Yeah, he actually hosts roast battles between comics and I was able to kind of be a part of and judge one of them and had a f------ blast with him,” he said. “So it’d be an honor to get roasted by Jeff but yeah, maybe that day will come.”
As for the Brady roast itself (which featured the seven-time Super Bowl champ firing some jokes at the Chiefs), Travis Kelce was impressed, saying it was “unbelievable.”
“Everybody involved, hats off,” he said.
“I’ve been in tears the whole last day, just watching the clips and everything. I wasn’t able to actually watch it live,” Travis Kelce continued. “But I tell you this man, I commend everybody because nobody seemed to get their feelings hurt. It just looked like everybody was having fun with it. But at the same time, man, that s--- had me rolling.”
Jason Kelce echoed the sentiment, although he isn’t exactly onboard with the idea of a roast.
“It was pure entertainment and I’m really happy they did it, but I just do not get the roasts. I don’t understand why people do them. Maybe I take myself too seriously,” he said.
Jason Kelce said it was fun to watch and see the turnout.
“The best part about was how many just iconic NFL and celebrities, just of immense stature that were there. Not to mention just the entire Patriots dynasty showed up for Tom,” he continued.

Netflix’s “The Roast of Tom Brady” had viewers doubled over in laughter. It also got Jason Kelce and his brother, Travis Kelce, thinking about who they would want to roast them if the opportunity presented itself.
“If I was picking who to roast me, I would pick people that like I would have no problem getting into a fistfight with, like family members,” Jason Kelce said on the May 8 episode of their “New Heights” podcast.
However, he drew the line at one person very close to him — his wife, Kylie Kelce.
“The one person I wouldn’t allow on the stage is Kylie because she knows way too much,” he said. “Cannot allow that.”
“I mean, every day I’m getting roasted by Kylie. I don’t need her to go up on stage and do that,” he added.
Travis Kelce, meanwhile, had a list of people that’d he be more than willing to fire zingers at him.
“Well, Santino’s one of my favorite comedians of all time and I think he would f------ deliver,” he said, possibly referring to Andrew Santino, who recently appeared on “New Heights.”
“Dave Chappelle is the all-time great. Kevin Hart. I would love Kevin to go up there and just f------ rip me in half,” Travis Kelce continued before praising Hart for the work he did on Brady’s roast.
He also mentioned Nikki Glaser, who drew raves for her performance at Brady’s roast.
“Nikki Glaser’s f------ hilarious. If I did a roast, you would have to get Nikki up there,” Travis Kelce said.
Travis Kelce also singled out well-known roaster Jeff Ross, who had one joke at the roast that viewers speculated might have rubbed Brady the wrong way.
“I met Jeff Ross out in L.A. at one of the Comedy Stores out there,” he said. “Yeah, he actually hosts roast battles between comics and I was able to kind of be a part of and judge one of them and had a f------ blast with him,” he said. “So it’d be an honor to get roasted by Jeff but yeah, maybe that day will come.”
As for the Brady roast itself (which featured the seven-time Super Bowl champ firing some jokes at the Chiefs), Travis Kelce was impressed, saying it was “unbelievable.”
“Everybody involved, hats off,” he said.
“I’ve been in tears the whole last day, just watching the clips and everything. I wasn’t able to actually watch it live,” Travis Kelce continued. “But I tell you this man, I commend everybody because nobody seemed to get their feelings hurt. It just looked like everybody was having fun with it. But at the same time, man, that s--- had me rolling.”
Jason Kelce echoed the sentiment, although he isn’t exactly onboard with the idea of a roast.
“It was pure entertainment and I’m really happy they did it, but I just do not get the roasts. I don’t understand why people do them. Maybe I take myself too seriously,” he said.
Jason Kelce said it was fun to watch and see the turnout.
