Devastation in Gaza as Israel wages war on Hamas

What we're covering
Here's how to help humanitarian efforts in Gaza and Israel.
UN chief "deeply troubled" by reports Israel using AI to identify targets in Gaza
From CNN's Ruba Alhenawi
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed concerns over reports of Israel's use of artificial intelligence (AI) in its war against Hamas in Gaza.
"I am deeply troubled by reports that the Israeli military’s bombing campaign includes AI as a tool in the identification of targets, resulting in a high level of civilian casualties. AI should be used as a force for good to benefit the world; not to contribute to waging war on an industrial level, blurring accountability," Guterres said in a post he shared on X late Friday.
His words come amid intensifying international scrutiny of Israel’s military campaign, after targeted airstrikes killed several foreign aid workers delivering food in the Palestinian enclave.
A recent investigation by online news publication +972 Magazine also revealed that Israel's military has been using artificial intelligence to help identify bombing targets in Gaza, and cited Israeli intelligence officials who had been involved in the alleged program.
When asked about the allegations, a spokesperson for the Israeli military did not dispute the existence of the tool but denied AI was being used to identify suspected terrorists.
Widespread destruction in northern Gaza will pose obstacle for potential aid shipments, satellite images show
From CNN's Paul P. Murphy
Israel has authorized the Erez crossing to be temporarily reopened, but aid shipments are likely to face significant logistical challenges because of just how much destruction there is in northern Gaza, especially to the road infrastructure, according to a CNN analysis of recent satellite imagery.
For the border crossing to be truly functional, authorities or aid agencies will likely need to clear and repair northern Gaza's roads or pave new ones, beyond the immediate crossing complex.
Several roadways in the crossing complex were bombed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the weeks after the attack. The new satellite images from Maxar Technologies show that further destruction by bombing and bulldozing occurred after the IDF ground invasion began in late October.
Some major roadways in the four towns closest to the crossing — Beit Lahia, Jabalya, Izbat Beit Hanoun and Beit Hanoun — have large craters that span the entirety of their surface. Others, including many side streets, are covered in debris and the remains of large residential buildings.
The Erez border crossing has been closed since Hamas militants stormed it – and took a number of prisoners from it – during the October 7 attack.
Israel has yet to say when and what kind of aid it will allow through the crossing. It's also unclear whether the DF will allow for aid distribution in northern Gaza, where they have been ordering all Palestinians to leave for months.
Oxfam and the United Nations estimate that well over a million Palestinians fled the north to the South, and only about 300,000 Palestinians remain in northern Gaza despite those IDF orders.
Humanitarian workers in Gaza unnerved after Israeli strike on WCK, aid group founder says
From CNN’s Caitlin Danaher
The American founder of a humanitarian aid organization assisting displaced people in Gaza said the situation for humanitarian workers in the enclave is “very unnerving" following the Israeli airstrike that killed seven World Central Kitchen staffers.
“To have that pit in your stomach of, 'Am I going to be targeted because I am part of an aid organization, or because this whole deconfliction process isn’t working properly?'” said Arwa Damon, the founder of the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance (INARA).
Damon, a former CNN correspondent, described the humanitarian situation as “inexplicably desperate” for the people of Gaza as organizations struggle to safely distribute aid.
“The minute you are out of your vehicle and they see that you're an aid organization, people swarm you because they have so little and they have zero faith as to whether or not aid is actually going to reach them. So it's complete chaos,” said Damon, speaking from Rafah in southern Gaza.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released a report Friday saying the deadly strike on the WCK aid convoy on Monday was carried out in "serious violation of the commands" and procedures, and "should not have happened."
WCK responded saying the IDF "cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza" and urged for systemic change. WCK also said the IDF acknowledged that the team " followed all proper communications procedures," but were attacked regardless.

US warns Iran not to use Damascus strike as “pretext to attack US personnel and facilities,” official says
From CNN's Jennifer Hansler and MJ Lee
The United States has warned Iran not to use the Israeli strike in Damascus earlier this week as “a pretext to attack US personnel and facilities,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN on Friday.
The warning was sent in response to a message from Iran, the spokesperson said, without providing details about the contents of the Iranian message.
“As Iran noted publicly, we received a message from them,” the spokesperson said. “We responded by warning Iran not to use this as a pretext to attack US personnel and facilities. We did not ‘ask.’”
The spokesperson did not provide further information about the US response or how it was conveyed to Iran.
A senior administration official described the US’ warning to Iran as: “Don’t think about coming after us.”
That official told CNN that the US is on high alert and actively preparing for a “significant” attack by Iran that could come as soon as within the next week, targeting Israeli or American assets in the region in response to Monday’s strike that killed top Iranian commanders.
US reviewing Israel's report on airstrike that killed 7 aid workers. Here's what you should know
From CNN staff
The US received Israel’s report on the deadly strike on a World Central Kitchen (WCK) convoy in Gaza and is “reviewing it very carefully,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday.
There are "no plans" for the US to conduct an independent or separate investigation, according to National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.
The Israel Defense Forces fired two of its officers and reprimanded others for their involvement in the strikes, but the WCK charity said Israel could not be trusted to investigate its own errors in Gaza.

Biden writes to leaders of Egypt and Qatar to ask them to secure commitments from Hamas, official says
From CNN's Nikki Carvajal and MJ Lee
US President Joe Biden wrote letters to the President of Egypt and the Emir of Qatar on Friday on the state of hostage talks between Israel and Hamas. He asked the leaders to “secure commitments from Hamas to agree to and abide by a deal,” a senior administration official says.
The letters come as hostage negotiations are set to resume in Egypt this weekend and will include US and Israeli officials.
“This basic fact remains true: There would be a ceasefire in Gaza today had Hamas simply agreed to release this vulnerable category of hostages – the sick, wounded, elderly, and young women,” the official said. “Holding these innocent people is outrageous and a reminder as to how this war started in the first place. The onus is on Hamas to release the hostages and bring relief to the people of Gaza through a prolonged ceasefire.”
National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will meet with the families of the hostages at the White House on Monday, the senior official added.
The status of hostage negotiations came up during Biden’s call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. On the call, Biden “made clear that everything must be done to secure the release of hostages, including American citizens, now held by Hamas terrorists for nearly six months.”
Biden and Netanyahu also discussed the importance of “fully empowering Israeli negotiators to reach a deal.”
CIA Director William Burns, Israel’s Mossad Director David Barnea and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar will meet in Cairo this weekend, a source familiar with the talks and an Israeli government official source previously told CNN.
US is actively preparing for a significant regional attack by Iran that could come within the next week
From CNN's MJ Lee
The US is on high alert and actively preparing for a “significant” attack within the next week by Iran targeting Israeli or American assets in the region in response to Monday’s Israeli strike in Damascus that killed top Iranian commanders, a senior administration official tells CNN.
Senior US officials currently believe that an attack by Iran is “inevitable” – a view shared by their Israeli counterparts, that official said.
The two governments are furiously working to get in position ahead of what is to come, as they anticipate that Iran’s attack could unfold in a number of different ways – and that both US and Israeli assets and personnel are at risk of being targeted.
A forthcoming Iranian attack was a major topic of discussion on President Joe Biden’s phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.
As of Friday, the two governments did not know when or how Iran planned to strike back, the official said.
A direct strike on Israel by Iran is one of the worst-case scenarios that the Biden administration is bracing for, as it would guarantee rapid escalation of an already tumultuous situation in the Middle East.
Such a strike could lead to the Israel-Hamas war broadening into a wider, regional conflict – something Biden has long sought to avoid.
Norwegian foreign minister describes frustration within NATO that Israel is "going too far" in Gaza
From CNN's Amy Cassidy, Eleanor Pickston and Isa Soares
Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told CNN of the “frustration” felt within NATO that Israel is “going too far” in Gaza after this week's attack on a World Central Kitchen (WCK) convoy that killed seven aid workers.
“Yesterday I was together with most of my Western foreign minister colleagues at the NATO meeting in Brussels and I could really feel that the frustration, even among those who have been most supportive of Israel until now, is that this is really going too far,” he told CNN’s Isa Soares on Friday.
Israel’s internal report into the aid convoy strikes that was published Friday, “brought home to us how easy it is for the Israeli forces to fire at people they believe to be or think are terrorists on what seems to be not very convincing evidence, to put it mildly," the foreign minister said.
“The only good thing about this tragic situation [is that] it seems that the level of critique and messaging from the entire world, including some of Israel’s closest allies, is now being stepped up, that you cannot continue to behave like this," Barth Eide said.
He went on to call for a ceasefire. "And from there on humanitarian aid and eventually a political solution," the minister said.
UN agency completes "highly complex mission" delivering medical aid to hospitals in northern Gaza
From CNN’s Ami Kaufman and Caitlin Danaher
The World Health Organization (WHO) completed a “highly complex mission” delivering medical aid to hospitals in northern Gaza on Thursday.
Despite “ongoing hostilities” in Gaza City, the supplies were delivered to around 1,000 patients at both Al Sahaba and Al Ahli hospitals, WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X Friday.
Al Sahaba hospital also received one pallet of canned food, and a patient with complex lower limb injuries was successfully moved from Al Ahli to a field hospital in Rafah, Tedros said.
“On the way to the north, some medical supplies and food were self-distributed by desperate, starving communities,” Tedros added, but urged that more medical supplies and food are needed to serve “hundreds of patients.”
Tedros concluded by repeating calls for a “sustained and safe passage for humanitarian aid” and appealed for an immediate ceasefire.
Some context: The successful delivery of much-needed medical supplies follows several months of difficulty getting aid where it is needed most in Gaza. The UN agency reported that heavy bombardment, movement restrictions and interrupted communications were making it nearly impossible to deliver medical supplies regularly and safely.
Medical aid relief teams were forced to call off repeated delivery missions in January after failing to receive security guarantees, WHO said at the time.
Israeli authorities denied 30% of humanitarian aid missions to northern Gaza in March, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported.

Taiwan shaken but unbowed as biggest quake in 25 years spotlights preparedness — and lessons learned
Wu was preparing breakfast for guests at the small hotel he runs in Taiwan’s Hualien County when the shelves around him shook violently and the mountain behind his house roared.
Fearing the building would collapse, he rushed his guests to safety outdoors. Across the river, steep slopes were slipping from the mountains, the air swallowed by clouds of dust.
But Wu’s house suffered little damage from Wednesday’s 7.4 magnitude tremor, Taiwan’s most powerful in 25 years, something he attributes to a wider push to make the island more quake-resistant.
“Our government conducted a comprehensive review of building codes after the 1999 earthquake, and all buildings going up must use new technologies that make them more resilient to earthquakes,” he says.
Fifteen years ago when he started building his two-story guesthouse near the entrance to Taroko Gorge – a national park famed for its steep, marble-walled canyons – Wu had to get government approval of its earthquake-preparedness.
And experts say changes like this have helped the tremor-prone island avoid mass casualties in quakes like the one that hit on Wednesday.
“I feel very lucky,” says Wu of the remarkably low-level damage wrought by the massive quake. “It’s not too bad.”
It’s a similar story in Hualien, a city just 11 miles from the epicenter, which looks strikingly calm the day after the tremor.
Stores and restaurants have reopened, as have roadside stalls selling fruit, vegetables and snacks. Trains to the city, suspended as a precaution on Wednesday, have resumed and are running on schedule.
The most potent sign of the quake is a 10-story red-brick tower in the city center, leaning precariously at a 45-degree angle after its ground floor collapsed. Excavators have heaped rubble at the base of the Uranus Building, to prop it up.
Emergency workers have started repairing dozens of damaged buildings and demolishing four deemed impossible to save. But for the most part, the city of 100,000 people on Taiwan’s scenic east coast has emerged unscathed.
That is not to understate the earthquake’s power. Taiwan’s seismologists describe the tremor as having an energy equivalent to 32 of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima. It rocked the entire island of Taiwan and was felt as far away as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Chong, a 52-year-old housekeeper, said she had lived through plenty of earthquakes in Hualien. “But the scale of this earthquake was very frightening,” she said. “I’ve never experienced an earthquake this big in my 50 years here in Hualien.”
Wednesday’s earthquake shook more parts of Taiwan with greater intensity than any other quake since 1999, when a 7.7 magnitude tremor hit the middle of the island, killing 2,400 people and injuring 10,000 others.
But this time, the number of casualties is much lower. As of Thursday, 10 people had been killed and just over 1,000 were injured, while two dozen remained missing, according to authorities.
“It is a pretty miraculous outcome,” said Daniel Aldrich, a professor of political science and public policy at Northeastern University who studies the resilience of cities, calling the toll “a very low number of deaths by a strong, powerful earthquake near an urban center.”
“The other disasters around 7.5 (magnitude) have caused far more casualties than we’ve seen so far in Taiwan,” he said, citing the tens of thousands of deaths during previous quakes in Haiti, India and China.
‘We grew up with quakes’
Wednesday’s quake struck Taiwan’s rural east coast. The island’s west is where most people live, home to the largest cities, an extensive high-speed rail network and much of the industrial heartland.
Most of the destruction – and deaths – occurred in remote rural areas in the wider Hualien County.
The victims were mostly killed outdoors by falling rocks or landslides. Four of them were hiking in Taroko Gorge, four died on mountainous highways, and another was working at a remote quarry, according to authorities.
So far, only one person was killed in a collapsed building – the Uranus Building in downtown Hualien. She initially escaped but went back to rescue her pet cat, CNN affiliate SET reported.
Taiwan’s recent push for preparedness comes from the hard lessons learned from the devastating quake 25 years ago, experts say.
When the earthquake struck in 1999, Taiwan was very unprepared, Aldrich said, citing corruption in the construction industry, the lack of building regulations, and inadequate coordination in rescue efforts.
That quake left more than 100,000 buildings across Taiwan completely or partially collapsed, including nearly 300 schools. Buildings were also flattened in the capital Taipei, about 100 miles from the epicenter.
“What we’ve seen since then are massive upgrades across the board, what I would call a top-down on a bottom-up set of responses,” Aldrich said.
From the top down, the government strengthened disaster management laws, improved coordination for rescue and relief, and enforced stricter building codes for earthquake resistance.
“They’ve issued massive fines and penalties for construction firms found to have in any way cut corners on their construction. And there has been a really serious investment in all the new buildings,” Aldrich said.
The government launched a campaign to evaluate, retrofit or rebuild public buildings to enhance their ability to withstand stronger quakes, with schools being a priority. The campaign has since extended to private buildings, such as Wu’s.
September 21 – the date the deadly earthquake struck in 1999 – is now a designated day for disaster drills in Taiwan, with mock alert messages sent to mobile phones across the island and schools staging evacuation exercises.
The mayor of Hualien, Wei Chia-yen, attributes the relatively low death toll in his city to advanced preparation.
“Here in Hualien, we grew up with earthquakes,” he said inside a gymnasium turned shelter at a primary school, set up within hours of the quake.
Rows of tents have been put up for residents whose homes have been damaged, or who are afraid to return due to aftershocks, while boxes of food and drinks are spread out on the tables.
Wei was himself injured by a cabinet falling on his left leg and was using crutches to get around the shelter.
“Our teachers and relatives always taught us how to react when earthquakes strike,” he said. “So we’ve known about this since we were kids.”

Elon Musk’s reversal on blue checkmarks shows his desperation to lure high-profile users back to X
Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
Elon Musk has given up, restoring the “lords and peasants” blue checkmark system he once admonished and assailed as elitism.
After insisting that journalists, celebrities and other notable users pay him $8 a month for Twitter’s once-coveted blue checkmark, the erratic billionaire has thrown in the towel, widely restoring blue badges to prominent accounts on the imperiled social media platform.
A number of people — including yours truly — woke up on Thursday to learn that X had declared them “an influential member of the community” and, thus, would be giving them “a complimentary subscription to X Premium.” The message the company sent to those users noted that X “reserves the right to cancel the complimentary subscription in its sole discretion.” (Translation: If you’re mean to Musk, you are likely putting yourself in jeopardy of losing it.)
The move is a major reversal by Musk, who made user payments for the blue checkmark a central tenet of his plan to build a subscription business on X and reduce the platform’s heavy dependency on advertiser dollars. “Trash me all day, but it’ll cost $8,” Musk insisted, endlessly repeating a version of that message to the vocal and constant complaints of users.
“To all complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8,” Musk declared.
Musk — who often uses his perch as the most-followed user on X to share absurd and dangerous right-wing conspiracy theories — also took glee in stripping journalists of their status. The thin-skinned Musk has repeatedly smeared the press and, when he took over the platform, made it a point to strip journalists of any special cachet they carried, framing it as a move aimed at empowering the masses.

Elon Musk’s X is back to giving out free blue checks. It’s no surprise they were a tough sell
“Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit,” Musk wrote in November 2022. “Power to the people!”
Naturally, users pushed back against his plans, noting that verification of journalists offered the public a helpful way of quickly identifying credible sources of news. In reality, the legacy verification system benefited the average user far more than it benefited those who were given the badges. But Musk, blind or disinterested in that reality, vigorously pushed back.
“You represent the problem: journalists who think they are the only source of legitimate information,” Musk wrote to one protesting user. “That’s the big lie.”
“Empowering the public relative to journalists sure is a great way to earn negative press 🤣🤣,” Musk said in another post.
But most journalists and other notable users who once sported the checkmark declined to fork over the cash. Instead, the people willing to shell out money for the status symbol consisted of a cocktail of Musk super-fans, right-wing trolls and others who would not have been able to attain a checkmark under the legacy system which required them to be a notable public figure. (Ironically, a fair continent of this group spent years mocking journalists for supposedly being obsessed with the checkmark, only to pay $8 for it while the journalists declined).
Even worse, trolls impersonating the identities of others were granted blue checkmarks, stripping the symbol of its core value: identity verification.
As a direct result, the once-coveted status symbol lost all its value, instead becoming a toxic sign of obedience and fealty to Musk, which many users rejected. This week, when Musk suddenly appended checkmarks to the accounts of “influential members of the community,” plenty of users loudly noted that they had not paid for it.
“What happened? I didn’t pay for this. I would NEVER pay for this,” actress Yvette Nicole Brown posted on X.
“Stating for the record I did NOT pay to have my check mark restored,” added the conservative commentator Amanda Carpenter.

Elon Musk’s X names new head of safety, nine months after former safety leader’s exit
A representative for X did not respond to a request for comment on Musk’s move to restore the blue checkmarks. But it’s obvious.
Since Musk’s disastrous takeover of the social media company, the platform has been on a downward spiral. Notably, X’s daily usage has plummeted over the last year, with the user base down a staggering 23%, according to data Sensor Tower provided NBC News’ David Ingram. Daily active users are down an additional 18%, the analytics firm added.
That’s an alarming trend for the platform, which likes to market itself as the place where live conversation occurs. Meanwhile, Meta’s X competitor, Threads, continues to show growth, with Mark Zuckerberg telling investors in February that the platform has grown to more than 130 million monthly active users. Zuckerberg has said that his goal is to get Threads to 1 billion users. And other platforms like Mastodon and BlueSky have also become refuges for Twitter exiles.
It all spells trouble for Musk, whose platform continues to descend into an uninhabitable right-wing fever swamp (quite frankly, it already can be fairly defined as such). Don’t just take my word for it, either. The evidence is plain as day in Musk’s own public actions. The billionaire has grown so desperate to lure back one-time power users, he is reversing course on what was his rallying cry against the elites.
Gone are the days when Musk poked the journalists and celebrity class about paying him $8 a month. Now, Musk is so desperate to see their return, he’s willing to crown them with the blue badge and restore their accounts to “lord” status. That says it all.

Angelina Jolie alleges ‘history’ of Brad Pitt’s physical abuse prior to 2016 plane ride in new Miraval lawsuit filing
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s fight over the French winery they once owned together is coming to a head and reigniting older conflicts, as new legal documents allege a “history of physical abuse of Jolie” on the part of Pitt prior to their fateful plane ride in 2016.
On Thursday, Jolie filed a motion with the Los Angeles Superior Court, a copy of which CNN has obtained, wherein she claims that she attempted to sell Pitt her stake in the Miraval winery and that their negotiations ultimately broke down after Pitt conditioned the sale on Jolie signing an NDA that “prohibited Jolie from speaking (other than in court) about Pitt’s abuse of Jolie and their children by attempting to tie Pitt’s personal reputation to Miraval’s business.”
This week’s new filing stems from Pitt’s 2022 lawsuit, in which he claimed that he and Jolie had an agreement that neither would sell their stake in the winery without the other’s consent. In a June 2023 filing, he alleged that Jolie’s sale of her stake in the winery was “vindictive” after an “adverse custody ruling.”
Jolie also claims in Thursday’s filing that Pitt’s “history of physical abuse of Jolie started well before the family’s September 2016 plane trip from France to Los Angeles,” but does not go into further detail about the alleged prior abuse.
“At trial, Jolie will prove through testimony, emails, photographs, and other evidence why Pitt was so concerned about his own misconduct that he blew up his own deal to purchase Jolie’s interest in Miraval because she refused to agree to his new, expansive NDA,” the filing reads.
Jolie claims in the filing on Thursday that she agreed to sign an NDA that was “limited to not disparaging Miraval’s wine business” as part of her initial deal to sell Pitt her stake in the winery, which they were close to finalizing at the time.
Pitt had previously claimed in his June 2023 amended complaint that after Jolie would not agree to sign his NDA, she proposed an even broader NDA that “would have provided that “[o]ther than in court pleadings or testimony, neither party shall directly or through a party’s representatives make in a public forum any derogatory remark about the other party.”
CNN has reached out to a representative for Pitt seeking comment on the new allegations outlined in Thursday’s filing.
“Mr. Pitt refused to purchase Ms. Jolie’s interest when she would not be silenced by his NDA. By refusing to buy her interest but then suing her, Mr. Pitt put directly at issue why that NDA was so important to him and what he hoped it would bury: his abuse of Ms. Jolie and their family,” Paul Murphy, Jolie’s attorney, told CNN in a statement on Thursday. “After eight months of delays, this motion asks the Court to force Mr. Pitt to finally produce that evidence.”
Jolie never ended up pressing charges against Pitt in relation to the 2016 altercation, according to the filing, because she believed “the best course was for Pitt to accept responsibility and help the family recover from the post-traumatic stress he caused.”
CNN previously reported that Pitt was not arrested or charged in connection with the 2016 incident after the FBI completed its investigation, and a representative for Pitt disputed Jolie’s account of that incident included in an October 2022 filing. Pitt’s representative said in a statement to CNN at the time that “Brad has accepted responsibility for what he did but will not for things he didn’t do.”
In October 2021, Jolie sold her half of the winery to Tenute del Mondo, a subsidiary of Stoli Group, controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler.
The ongoing legal proceedings and “Pitt’s unyielding attempts to control and punish Jolie continue to take a huge emotional and financial toll on her and their family,” the filing reads. “Jolie longs for their family to be able to heal and their children to be spared further pain and trauma, and truly wishes Pitt would want the same too.”
Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in 2016. They were declared legally single in 2019, and a joint custody arrangement was established in 2021.
Legal proceedings as they pertain to the Miraval dispute also remain ongoing. The former couple purchased the country estate and winery in the south of France in 2008.

Unseen photos show a day in the life of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love
Photographs by Guzman Story by Kyle AlmondPublished April 5, 2024
Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love lie in bed with their baby daughter, Frances Bean, in September 1992.
They were greeted at the front door by rock star Courtney Love, who welcomed them into the Los Angeles home she shared with her husband, Kurt Cobain.
She offered coffee and a slice of âjust deliveredâ guava pie.
Photographers Constance Hansen and Russell Peacock politely declined, eager to get to work. They were on assignment for Spin magazine, which was doing a cover story on the famous couple.
Love showed them around the house, a modest three-bedroom Craftsman in the Hollywood Heights neighborhood, as they waited for Cobain to come downstairs.
He never came down.
So instead, they went up to him.
When they got to Cobainâs room, they found the Nirvana frontman still in bed.
They introduced themselves and asked him if it was OK to take pictures. He nodded. He seemed unfazed by the whole thing. Meeting strangers in bed? No big deal, it seemed.
âThirty years later, we thought, well maybe that was the whole plan all along. Because he was wearing this fancy robe, and thatâs not something he would ever wear normally,â said Peacock, who along with Hansen forms the photography duo known simply as Guzman.
The photos that followed would come to be known as some of Cobainâs most famous. And a soon-to-be-released book, âFamily Values: Kurt, Courtney & Frances Bean,â includes nearly 100 photos from the day, most of which have never been published.
These photos were taken in September 1992, a year after the album âNevermindâ launched Nirvana â and Cobain â into superstardom. But over that time there were some personal struggles.
Cobain was in rehab for heroin addiction earlier in the month, and he had checked into a hospital a month before that to detox, according to Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad, who wrote the photo bookâs introduction. A story in Vanity Fair magazine, released weeks before this photo session, didnât paint the couple in the greatest light, and they were fighting for custody of their newborn daughter, Frances Bean. When Hansen and Peacock visited their home, there was a court-mandated nanny there.
The Spin magazine story gave the rock stars a chance to reframe the narrative.
When Hansen and Peacock were first given the assignment, they came up with a fun premise they thought they might try at first.
âWe were going to (show) them homemaking, doing domestic chores and things like that,â Hansen remembers. âWe were laughing on the way out (to Los Angeles). We were like, yeah, theyâll be mowing the lawn or ironing or cooking.â
Soon after arriving to the house, they quickly realized that wouldnât be the vibe. They followed their subjectsâ lead, and it all started with Cobain in bed.
It worked out for the best.
âPhotographing someone in bed is great, because theyâre vulnerable and itâs very personal,â Peacock said.
The duo took photos of Cobain and his room, which he said he was fine with. But he was never as comfortable in front of the camera as his wife was.
A short while later, Love came up with their baby girl and everything changed.
âHaving the baby there made a big difference, I think. It made him more open,â Peacock said. âAnd so it was kind of fortuitous to have the baby there. We kind of joked like, wow, we should bring babies on more shoots because they open people up.â
Now the entire family was in bed together, and Hansen remembers how beautiful it was to see everyone in sync. âThey just were loving Frances. It was really so apparent,â she said. âIt was really about her. They were oblivious to us in a lot of cases, anytime they had the baby.â
Eventually, everyone would come back downstairs for more photos, including individual portraits for both Cobain and Love.
At one point, Cobain grabbed a marker and began writing the words âfamily valuesâ on his wifeâs stomach. At the time in 1992, âfamily valuesâ was also a campaign theme for the Republican Party going into Novemberâs election.
âWe just went with it. We didnât know (what it meant),â Hansen said.
On his own stomach, Cobain wrote âdiet grrrl,â a play on words with the feminist punk movement âriot grrrl.â
Hansen and Peacock spent a few hours taking photos for what is now known among music fans as the âfamily valuesâ story. They often took photos simultaneously, and they used many different types of cameras and setups to get a variety of looks. Some are more polished and posed. Others are more gritty and spontaneous.
When the story was published by Spin, only a few images were included. The rest were tucked away in storage. Recently, friends from the LABspace gallery in New York asked Hansen and Peacock about that day and wanted to see more. The photos were exhibited at the gallery before becoming a book.
Many people remember the Spin article and tell the photographers that they had it on their wall when they were growing up.
âWe didnât realize the effect that those pictures had,â Hansen said.
The photos are now especially poignant because of Cobainâs tragic suicide.
Thirty years ago, in April 1994, Cobain took his own life at the age of 27. It was a shocking story that shook a generation of music fans.
âHe was an extraordinary musician and lyricist,â Hansen said. âHe was really different, too. He took it to another level. He wasnât derivative, He was just really special.â
Peacock said Cobain and Nirvana came at the perfect time, ushering in rockâs grunge era.
âThe timing was just right for that music, and it embedded itself in the culture like the Beatles or the Rolling Stones,â he said.
After Cobain died, Hansen and Peacock sent a few snapshots of him to Love at her request. They would later work with her on an album cover for her band Hole.
Theyâre looking forward to going on the book tour later this year, to hear more about how Cobain and Nirvana impacted lives. âTheir music still resonates with people,â Peacock said. âWe were in a coffee shop a couple weeks ago and thereâs a young girl in a Nirvana T-shirt. Itâs interesting.â
Working on the book has made the photographers think deeper about the Spin assignment and what might have been going on beneath the surface.
âI think there was a lot of vulnerability in the house at that moment,â Peacock said. âI didnât think about it at the time, but looking back, everything swirling around them, it must have been very intense to be so successful so quickly and struggle with that. Looking back, that feeling is there.â
The book âFamily Values: Kurt, Courtney & Frances Beanâ is being published by powerHouse Books and can now be pre-ordered.

Plans for $1.3 billion waterfront development in Oman unveiled
Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.
Oman’s capital of Muscat is set to get an expansive $1.3 billion waterfront development, designed by globally renowned Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA).
The 3.3 million square-meter Al Khuwair Muscat Downtown and Waterfront development will include a residential complex, a marina, a cultural district, numerous canal walkways and a ministerial campus. Work is set to start at the end of this year and the area is expected to house more than 60,000 people when completed.
ZHA’s associate director, architect Paolo Zilli, told CNN he spent around a year finalizing the model he presented to Oman’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning.
Central to ZIlli’s design was facilitating access to public transport. “The vision is actually to remove all the cars, to remove all the fences and to create a campus of the ministry with many functions that can attract families and a new generation,” he said.
ZHA says it will encourage pedestrians by providing shading and passive cooling, and incorporate infrastructure to improve cycling safety. The use of onsite solar power will be “maximized” and native plant species will be conserved and restored.
Oman’s economy has long depended on oil, but it is now investing heavily in real-estate projects to drive more foreign investment, and ultimately boost non-oil revenues, part of the country’s National Vision 2040 strategy. In Muscat, the population is projected to increase from 1.5 million to 2.7 million by that year.
“There are a lot of changes,” Dr. Khalfan bin Saeed bin Mubarak al-Shueili, Oman’s Minister of Housing and Urban Planning, told CNN. “We [are] going to change the economy based on talent and capability skills and maybe also the digital sector.
“In Muscat itself, we anticipate the requirement of another 300,000 homes. And if we are doing good, then … this probably could expand to 600,000 homes.”
UK-based Zaha Hadid Architects is named after its storied founder, who in 2004 became the first woman to win architecture’s highest honor, the Pritzker Prize. She died in 2016, having designed high-profile buildings from Guangzhou Opera House, in China, to the Phaeno science centre in Wolfsburg, Germany. Since then, ZHA’s designs include the BEEAH Headquarters in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, which is partly powered by Tesla battery packs, and in 2022 it unveiled plans for a virtual city in the metaverse, intended to be a cyber libertarian utopia.

JetZero: Groundbreaking ‘blended-wing’ demonstrator plane cleared to fly
The next generation of greener planes
The basic design of commercial airplanes hasn’t changed much in the past 60 years. Modern airliners like the Boeing 787 and the Airbus A350 have the same general shape as the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8, which were built in the late 1950s and solidified the “tube and wing” form factor that is still in use today.
This is because commercial aviation prioritizes safety, favoring tried-and-tested solutions, and because other developments — in materials and engines, for example — mean the traditional design is still relevant.
However, a seismic shake-up is about to take place. An entirely new aircraft shape has been cleared to take off into California skies. At the end of last month, Long Beach-based JetZero announced that Pathfinder, its 1:8 scale “blended wing body” demonstrator plane, has been granted an FAA Airworthiness certificate and test flights are imminent.
As the industry desperately looks for ways to reduce carbon emissions, it faces a somewhat tougher challenge than other sectors precisely because its core technologies have proven so hard to move away from. It’s a ripe time to innovate.
The “blended wing body” looks similar to the “flying wing” design used by military aircraft such as the iconic B-2 bomber, but the blended wing has more volume in the middle section. Both Boeing and Airbus are tinkering with the idea, and JetZero’s new milestone brings it a little closer to its ambitious goal of putting into service a blended wing aircraft as soon as 2030.
“We feel very strongly about a path to zero emissions in big jets, and the blended wing airframe can deliver 50% lower fuel burn and emissions,” Tom O’Leary, co-founder and CEO of JetZero, told CNN in August 2023. “That is a staggering leap forward in comparison to what the industry is used to.”
Under pressure
The blended wing concept is far from new, and the earliest attempts at building airplanes with this design date back to the late 1920s in Germany. American aircraft designer and industrialist Jack Northrop created a jet-powered flying wing design in 1947, which inspired the B-2 in the 1990s.
As a sort of hybrid between a flying wing and a traditional “tube and wing,” the blended wing allows the entire aircraft to generate lift, minimizing drag. NASA says that this shape “helps to increase fuel economy and creates larger payload (cargo or passenger) areas in the center body portion of the aircraft.” The agency has tested it through one of its experimental planes, the X-48.
Over about 120 test flights between 2007 and 2012, two unmanned, remote-controlled X-48s demonstrated the viability of the concept. “An aircraft of this type would have a wingspan slightly greater than a Boeing 747 and could operate from existing airport terminals,” the agency says, adding that the plane would also “weigh less, generate less noise and emissions, and cost less to operate than an equally advanced conventional transport aircraft.”

Gigantic new aircraft design aims to create the largest plane ever to fly
In 2020, Airbus built a small-blended wing demonstrator, about six feet in length, signaling interest in pursuing a full-size aircraft in the future. But if the shape is so effective, why haven’t we yet moved to building planes based on it?
According to O’Leary, there is one main technical challenge holding manufacturers back. “It’s the pressurization of a non-cylindrical fuselage,” he says, pointing to the fact that a tube-shaped plane is better able to handle the constant expansion and contraction cycles that come with each flight.
“If you think about a ‘tube and wing,’ it separates the loads — you have the pressurization load on the tube, and the bending loads on the wings. But a blended wing essentially blends those together. Only now can we do that with composite materials that are both light and strong.”
Such a radically new shape would make the interior of the plane look and feel wildly different to today’s widebody aircraft. “It’s just a much, much wider fuselage,” O’Leary says. “Your typical single-aisle plane has three by three seats, but this is a sort of a shorter, wider tube. You get the same amount of people, but you might have 15 or 20 rows across the cabin, depending upon how each particular airline will configure it.
“This just gives them a whole new palette with which to lay it out. I think it’s going to be amazing to see what their interpretation of this much broader space will be.”
Revolutionary potential
O’Leary says that the nearest equivalent in terms of size would be the Boeing 767 – a widebody, twin-engine plane introduced in the 1980s that typically carried around 210 passengers. It’s still produced as a cargo plane but was replaced by the Boeing 787 as a passenger aircraft. It also has a modern military variant, the KC-46, which the US Air Force uses for aerial refueling.
Similarly, JetZero wants to simultaneously develop three variants: a passenger plane with seating for 200-plus passengers, a cargo plane and a fuel tanker. The blended wing shape lends itself so well to the latter that last year the US Air Force awarded JetZero $235 million to develop a full-scale demonstrator and validate the performance of the blended wing concept.  The military version of the plane is scheduled to lead the way and perhaps support the development of the commercial models.
The newly FAA-approved Pathfinder, with its 23-foot wingspan, is a 12.5%-scale version of the full-scale demonstrator, which is expected to take flight by 2027. The plane is designed for 100% compatibility with Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) and to have the internal volume to accommodate zero-carbon emissions hydrogen.
However, building an entirely new airplane from scratch is an enormous task, and JetZero’s targets sound ambitious, given that the full process of certification for even a variant of an existing aircraft can take years. One advantage JetZero has in this area is that the plane will initially borrow engines from today’s narrowbody aircraft, like the Boeing 737 — although the plan is to eventually move to completely emission-free propulsion powered by hydrogen, which would require new engines that haven’t yet been developed.
JetZero hasn’t announced any orders for its plane, but O’Leary told CNN last year that airlines are interested. “We’re talking to all the major airlines globally already, because they’re excited to hear about the efficiency gains.”
It remains to be seen whether a 50% reduction in fuel use is actually possible. Both NASA and Airbus quoted a more modest 20% for their designs, while the US Air Force says a blended wing aircraft could “improve aerodynamic efficiency by at least 30% over current Air Force tanker and mobility aircraft.”

Supersonic planes will replace conventional jets in our lifetime, says aviation CEO
“It’s important to note that while a blended wing body can reduce drag and increase fuel efficiency, the actual benefits depend on the specific design, configuration, and operational conditions,” says Bailey Miles, an aviation analyst at consulting firm AviationValues.
“Extensive aerodynamic testing and optimization are essential to fully realize the drag reduction potential of this innovative aircraft design. It would be hard to determine a specific percentage fuel reduction without the necessary tests,” he adds.
According to ﻿Miles, the blended wing design is a “revolutionary” idea that has potential, but it comes with a number of hurdles, specifically an increased aerodynamic complexity that can make design and testing tricky, a series of regulatory and certification challenges, and a shape that may not be suitable for existing airport infrastructure.
“The blended wing body aircraft holds immense promise as a game changer in the aviation industry, offering the potential for improved fuel efficiency, enhanced payload capacity, and innovative control systems. However, addressing the aerodynamic complexities, ensuring structural integrity, navigating regulatory hurdles, and adapting airport infrastructure are formidable challenges that must be overcome for it to become a reality,” he says, adding that these challenges, among others, make JetZero’s target of 2030 for entry into service “inconceivable.”
According to Richard Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at consulting firm Aerodynamic Advisory, while not all of JetZero’s claims can be verified, “the idea of a blended wing body has been quite appealing for years, and it sounds like they’ve done some very interesting research. My colleagues and I regard it as quite promising.”
He is concerned that the firm is mostly “a design shop” at the moment, but he believes that the project may take off with the help of contractors. “There’s certainly room for somebody who actually wants to add value in this industry,” he says.

Devastation in Gaza as Israel wages war on Hamas
By Brad Lendon, Christian Edwards, Leinz Vales, Tori B. Powell and Elise Hammond, CNN
What we're covering
Here's how to help humanitarian efforts in Gaza and Israel.
UN chief "deeply troubled" by reports Israel using AI to identify targets in Gaza
From CNN's Ruba Alhenawi
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed concerns over reports of Israel's use of artificial intelligence (AI) in its war against Hamas in Gaza.
"I am deeply troubled by reports that the Israeli military’s bombing campaign includes AI as a tool in the identification of targets, resulting in a high level of civilian casualties. AI should be used as a force for good to benefit the world; not to contribute to waging war on an industrial level, blurring accountability," Guterres said in a post he shared on X late Friday.
His words come amid intensifying international scrutiny of Israel’s military campaign, after targeted airstrikes killed several foreign aid workers delivering food in the Palestinian enclave.
A recent investigation by online news publication +972 Magazine also revealed that Israel's military has been using artificial intelligence to help identify bombing targets in Gaza, and cited Israeli intelligence officials who had been involved in the alleged program.
When asked about the allegations, a spokesperson for the Israeli military did not dispute the existence of the tool but denied AI was being used to identify suspected terrorists.
Widespread destruction in northern Gaza will pose obstacle for potential aid shipments, satellite images show
From CNN's Paul P. Murphy
Israel has authorized the Erez crossing to be temporarily reopened, but aid shipments are likely to face significant logistical challenges because of just how much destruction there is in northern Gaza, especially to the road infrastructure, according to a CNN analysis of recent satellite imagery.
For the border crossing to be truly functional, authorities or aid agencies will likely need to clear and repair northern Gaza's roads or pave new ones, beyond the immediate crossing complex.
Several roadways in the crossing complex were bombed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the weeks after the attack. The new satellite images from Maxar Technologies show that further destruction by bombing and bulldozing occurred after the IDF ground invasion began in late October.
Some major roadways in the four towns closest to the crossing — Beit Lahia, Jabalya, Izbat Beit Hanoun and Beit Hanoun — have large craters that span the entirety of their surface. Others, including many side streets, are covered in debris and the remains of large residential buildings.
The Erez border crossing has been closed since Hamas militants stormed it – and took a number of prisoners from it – during the October 7 attack.
Israel has yet to say when and what kind of aid it will allow through the crossing. It's also unclear whether the DF will allow for aid distribution in northern Gaza, where they have been ordering all Palestinians to leave for months.
Oxfam and the United Nations estimate that well over a million Palestinians fled the north to the South, and only about 300,000 Palestinians remain in northern Gaza despite those IDF orders.
Humanitarian workers in Gaza unnerved after Israeli strike on WCK, aid group founder says
From CNN’s Caitlin Danaher
The American founder of a humanitarian aid organization assisting displaced people in Gaza said the situation for humanitarian workers in the enclave is “very unnerving" following the Israeli airstrike that killed seven World Central Kitchen staffers.
“To have that pit in your stomach of, 'Am I going to be targeted because I am part of an aid organization, or because this whole deconfliction process isn’t working properly?'” said Arwa Damon, the founder of the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance (INARA).
Damon, a former CNN correspondent, described the humanitarian situation as “inexplicably desperate” for the people of Gaza as organizations struggle to safely distribute aid.
“The minute you are out of your vehicle and they see that you're an aid organization, people swarm you because they have so little and they have zero faith as to whether or not aid is actually going to reach them. So it's complete chaos,” said Damon, speaking from Rafah in southern Gaza.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released a report Friday saying the deadly strike on the WCK aid convoy on Monday was carried out in "serious violation of the commands" and procedures, and "should not have happened."
WCK responded saying the IDF "cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza" and urged for systemic change. WCK also said the IDF acknowledged that the team " followed all proper communications procedures," but were attacked regardless.

US warns Iran not to use Damascus strike as “pretext to attack US personnel and facilities,” official says
From CNN's Jennifer Hansler and MJ Lee
The United States has warned Iran not to use the Israeli strike in Damascus earlier this week as “a pretext to attack US personnel and facilities,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN on Friday.
The warning was sent in response to a message from Iran, the spokesperson said, without providing details about the contents of the Iranian message.
“As Iran noted publicly, we received a message from them,” the spokesperson said. “We responded by warning Iran not to use this as a pretext to attack US personnel and facilities. We did not ‘ask.’”
The spokesperson did not provide further information about the US response or how it was conveyed to Iran.
A senior administration official described the US’ warning to Iran as: “Don’t think about coming after us.”
That official told CNN that the US is on high alert and actively preparing for a “significant” attack by Iran that could come as soon as within the next week, targeting Israeli or American assets in the region in response to Monday’s strike that killed top Iranian commanders.

From CNN staff
The US received Israel’s report on the deadly strike on a World Central Kitchen (WCK) convoy in Gaza and is “reviewing it very carefully,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday.
There are "no plans" for the US to conduct an independent or separate investigation, according to National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.
The Israel Defense Forces fired two of its officers and reprimanded others for their involvement in the strikes, but the WCK charity said Israel could not be trusted to investigate its own errors in Gaza.

Biden writes to leaders of Egypt and Qatar to ask them to secure commitments from Hamas, official says
From CNN's Nikki Carvajal and MJ Lee
US President Joe Biden wrote letters to the President of Egypt and the Emir of Qatar on Friday on the state of hostage talks between Israel and Hamas. He asked the leaders to “secure commitments from Hamas to agree to and abide by a deal,” a senior administration official says.
The letters come as hostage negotiations are set to resume in Egypt this weekend and will include US and Israeli officials.
“This basic fact remains true: There would be a ceasefire in Gaza today had Hamas simply agreed to release this vulnerable category of hostages – the sick, wounded, elderly, and young women,” the official said. “Holding these innocent people is outrageous and a reminder as to how this war started in the first place. The onus is on Hamas to release the hostages and bring relief to the people of Gaza through a prolonged ceasefire.”
National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will meet with the families of the hostages at the White House on Monday, the senior official added.
The status of hostage negotiations came up during Biden’s call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. On the call, Biden “made clear that everything must be done to secure the release of hostages, including American citizens, now held by Hamas terrorists for nearly six months.”
Biden and Netanyahu also discussed the importance of “fully empowering Israeli negotiators to reach a deal.”
CIA Director William Burns, Israel’s Mossad Director David Barnea and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar will meet in Cairo this weekend, a source familiar with the talks and an Israeli government official source previously told CNN.
US is actively preparing for a significant regional attack by Iran that could come within the next week
From CNN's MJ Lee
The US is on high alert and actively preparing for a “significant” attack within the next week by Iran targeting Israeli or American assets in the region in response to Monday’s Israeli strike in Damascus that killed top Iranian commanders, a senior administration official tells CNN.
Senior US officials currently believe that an attack by Iran is “inevitable” – a view shared by their Israeli counterparts, that official said.
The two governments are furiously working to get in position ahead of what is to come, as they anticipate that Iran’s attack could unfold in a number of different ways – and that both US and Israeli assets and personnel are at risk of being targeted.
A forthcoming Iranian attack was a major topic of discussion on President Joe Biden’s phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.
As of Friday, the two governments did not know when or how Iran planned to strike back, the official said.
A direct strike on Israel by Iran is one of the worst-case scenarios that the Biden administration is bracing for, as it would guarantee rapid escalation of an already tumultuous situation in the Middle East.
Such a strike could lead to the Israel-Hamas war broadening into a wider, regional conflict – something Biden has long sought to avoid.
Norwegian foreign minister describes frustration within NATO that Israel is "going too far" in Gaza
From CNN's Amy Cassidy, Eleanor Pickston and Isa Soares
Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told CNN of the “frustration” felt within NATO that Israel is “going too far” in Gaza after this week's attack on a World Central Kitchen (WCK) convoy that killed seven aid workers.
“Yesterday I was together with most of my Western foreign minister colleagues at the NATO meeting in Brussels and I could really feel that the frustration, even among those who have been most supportive of Israel until now, is that this is really going too far,” he told CNN’s Isa Soares on Friday.
Israel’s internal report into the aid convoy strikes that was published Friday, “brought home to us how easy it is for the Israeli forces to fire at people they believe to be or think are terrorists on what seems to be not very convincing evidence, to put it mildly," the foreign minister said.
“The only good thing about this tragic situation [is that] it seems that the level of critique and messaging from the entire world, including some of Israel’s closest allies, is now being stepped up, that you cannot continue to behave like this," Barth Eide said.
He went on to call for a ceasefire. "And from there on humanitarian aid and eventually a political solution," the minister said.
UN agency completes "highly complex mission" delivering medical aid to hospitals in northern Gaza
From CNN’s Ami Kaufman and Caitlin Danaher
The World Health Organization (WHO) completed a “highly complex mission” delivering medical aid to hospitals in northern Gaza on Thursday.
Despite “ongoing hostilities” in Gaza City, the supplies were delivered to around 1,000 patients at both Al Sahaba and Al Ahli hospitals, WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X Friday.
Al Sahaba hospital also received one pallet of canned food, and a patient with complex lower limb injuries was successfully moved from Al Ahli to a field hospital in Rafah, Tedros said.
“On the way to the north, some medical supplies and food were self-distributed by desperate, starving communities,” Tedros added, but urged that more medical supplies and food are needed to serve “hundreds of patients.”
Tedros concluded by repeating calls for a “sustained and safe passage for humanitarian aid” and appealed for an immediate ceasefire.
Some context: The successful delivery of much-needed medical supplies follows several months of difficulty getting aid where it is needed most in Gaza. The UN agency reported that heavy bombardment, movement restrictions and interrupted communications were making it nearly impossible to deliver medical supplies regularly and safely.
Medical aid relief teams were forced to call off repeated delivery missions in January after failing to receive security guarantees, WHO said at the time.
Israeli authorities denied 30% of humanitarian aid missions to northern Gaza in March, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported.

Norwegian foreign minister describes frustration within NATO that Israel is "going too far" in Gaza
From CNN's Amy Cassidy, Eleanor Pickston and Isa Soares
Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide told CNN of the “frustration” felt within NATO that Israel is “going too far” in Gaza after this week's attack on a World Central Kitchen (WCK) convoy that killed seven aid workers.
“Yesterday I was together with most of my Western foreign minister colleagues at the NATO meeting in Brussels and I could really feel that the frustration, even among those who have been most supportive of Israel until now, is that this is really going too far,” he told CNN’s Isa Soares on Friday.
Israel’s internal report into the aid convoy strikes that was published Friday, “brought home to us how easy it is for the Israeli forces to fire at people they believe to be or think are terrorists on what seems to be not very convincing evidence, to put it mildly," the foreign minister said.
“The only good thing about this tragic situation [is that] it seems that the level of critique and messaging from the entire world, including some of Israel’s closest allies, is now being stepped up, that you cannot continue to behave like this," Barth Eide said.
He went on to call for a ceasefire. "And from there on humanitarian aid and eventually a political solution," the minister said.
UN agency completes "highly complex mission" delivering medical aid to hospitals in northern Gaza
From CNN’s Ami Kaufman and Caitlin Danaher
The World Health Organization (WHO) completed a “highly complex mission” delivering medical aid to hospitals in northern Gaza on Thursday.
Despite “ongoing hostilities” in Gaza City, the supplies were delivered to around 1,000 patients at both Al Sahaba and Al Ahli hospitals, WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a post on X Friday.
Al Sahaba hospital also received one pallet of canned food, and a patient with complex lower limb injuries was successfully moved from Al Ahli to a field hospital in Rafah, Tedros said.
“On the way to the north, some medical supplies and food were self-distributed by desperate, starving communities,” Tedros added, but urged that more medical supplies and food are needed to serve “hundreds of patients.”
Tedros concluded by repeating calls for a “sustained and safe passage for humanitarian aid” and appealed for an immediate ceasefire.
Some context: The successful delivery of much-needed medical supplies follows several months of difficulty getting aid where it is needed most in Gaza. The UN agency reported that heavy bombardment, movement restrictions and interrupted communications were making it nearly impossible to deliver medical supplies regularly and safely.
Medical aid relief teams were forced to call off repeated delivery missions in January after failing to receive security guarantees, WHO said at the time.
Israeli authorities denied 30% of humanitarian aid missions to northern Gaza in March, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reported.

Israel-Hamas war

Devastation in Gaza as Israel wages war on Hamas
By Brad Lendon, Christian Edwards, Leinz Vales, Tori B. Powell and Elise Hammond, CNN
What we're covering
Here's how to help humanitarian efforts in Gaza and Israel.
UN chief "deeply troubled" by reports Israel using AI to identify targets in Gaza
From CNN's Ruba Alhenawi
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has expressed concerns over reports of Israel's use of artificial intelligence (AI) in its war against Hamas in Gaza.
"I am deeply troubled by reports that the Israeli military’s bombing campaign includes AI as a tool in the identification of targets, resulting in a high level of civilian casualties. AI should be used as a force for good to benefit the world; not to contribute to waging war on an industrial level, blurring accountability," Guterres said in a post he shared on X late Friday.
His words come amid intensifying international scrutiny of Israel’s military campaign, after targeted airstrikes killed several foreign aid workers delivering food in the Palestinian enclave.
A recent investigation by online news publication +972 Magazine also revealed that Israel's military has been using artificial intelligence to help identify bombing targets in Gaza, and cited Israeli intelligence officials who had been involved in the alleged program.
When asked about the allegations, a spokesperson for the Israeli military did not dispute the existence of the tool but denied AI was being used to identify suspected terrorists.
Widespread destruction in northern Gaza will pose obstacle for potential aid shipments, satellite images show
From CNN's Paul P. Murphy
Israel has authorized the Erez crossing to be temporarily reopened, but aid shipments are likely to face significant logistical challenges because of just how much destruction there is in northern Gaza, especially to the road infrastructure, according to a CNN analysis of recent satellite imagery.
For the border crossing to be truly functional, authorities or aid agencies will likely need to clear and repair northern Gaza's roads or pave new ones, beyond the immediate crossing complex.
Several roadways in the crossing complex were bombed by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) in the weeks after the attack. The new satellite images from Maxar Technologies show that further destruction by bombing and bulldozing occurred after the IDF ground invasion began in late October.
Some major roadways in the four towns closest to the crossing — Beit Lahia, Jabalya, Izbat Beit Hanoun and Beit Hanoun — have large craters that span the entirety of their surface. Others, including many side streets, are covered in debris and the remains of large residential buildings.
The Erez border crossing has been closed since Hamas militants stormed it – and took a number of prisoners from it – during the October 7 attack.
Israel has yet to say when and what kind of aid it will allow through the crossing. It's also unclear whether the DF will allow for aid distribution in northern Gaza, where they have been ordering all Palestinians to leave for months.
Oxfam and the United Nations estimate that well over a million Palestinians fled the north to the South, and only about 300,000 Palestinians remain in northern Gaza despite those IDF orders.
Humanitarian workers in Gaza unnerved after Israeli strike on WCK, aid group founder says
From CNN’s Caitlin Danaher
The American founder of a humanitarian aid organization assisting displaced people in Gaza said the situation for humanitarian workers in the enclave is “very unnerving" following the Israeli airstrike that killed seven World Central Kitchen staffers.
“To have that pit in your stomach of, 'Am I going to be targeted because I am part of an aid organization, or because this whole deconfliction process isn’t working properly?'” said Arwa Damon, the founder of the International Network for Aid, Relief and Assistance (INARA).
Damon, a former CNN correspondent, described the humanitarian situation as “inexplicably desperate” for the people of Gaza as organizations struggle to safely distribute aid.
“The minute you are out of your vehicle and they see that you're an aid organization, people swarm you because they have so little and they have zero faith as to whether or not aid is actually going to reach them. So it's complete chaos,” said Damon, speaking from Rafah in southern Gaza.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) released a report Friday saying the deadly strike on the WCK aid convoy on Monday was carried out in "serious violation of the commands" and procedures, and "should not have happened."
WCK responded saying the IDF "cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza" and urged for systemic change. WCK also said the IDF acknowledged that the team " followed all proper communications procedures," but were attacked regardless.

US warns Iran not to use Damascus strike as “pretext to attack US personnel and facilities,” official says
From CNN's Jennifer Hansler and MJ Lee
The United States has warned Iran not to use the Israeli strike in Damascus earlier this week as “a pretext to attack US personnel and facilities,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN on Friday.
The warning was sent in response to a message from Iran, the spokesperson said, without providing details about the contents of the Iranian message.
“As Iran noted publicly, we received a message from them,” the spokesperson said. “We responded by warning Iran not to use this as a pretext to attack US personnel and facilities. We did not ‘ask.’”
The spokesperson did not provide further information about the US response or how it was conveyed to Iran.
A senior administration official described the US’ warning to Iran as: “Don’t think about coming after us.”
That official told CNN that the US is on high alert and actively preparing for a “significant” attack by Iran that could come as soon as within the next week, targeting Israeli or American assets in the region in response to Monday’s strike that killed top Iranian commanders.
US reviewing Israel's report on airstrike that killed 7 aid workers. Here's what you should know
From CNN staff
The US received Israel’s report on the deadly strike on a World Central Kitchen (WCK) convoy in Gaza and is “reviewing it very carefully,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Friday.
There are "no plans" for the US to conduct an independent or separate investigation, according to National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby.
The Israel Defense Forces fired two of its officers and reprimanded others for their involvement in the strikes, but the WCK charity said Israel could not be trusted to investigate its own errors in Gaza.

Biden writes to leaders of Egypt and Qatar to ask them to secure commitments from Hamas, official says
From CNN's Nikki Carvajal and MJ Lee
US President Joe Biden wrote letters to the President of Egypt and the Emir of Qatar on Friday on the state of hostage talks between Israel and Hamas. He asked the leaders to “secure commitments from Hamas to agree to and abide by a deal,” a senior administration official says.
The letters come as hostage negotiations are set to resume in Egypt this weekend and will include US and Israeli officials.
“This basic fact remains true: There would be a ceasefire in Gaza today had Hamas simply agreed to release this vulnerable category of hostages – the sick, wounded, elderly, and young women,” the official said. “Holding these innocent people is outrageous and a reminder as to how this war started in the first place. The onus is on Hamas to release the hostages and bring relief to the people of Gaza through a prolonged ceasefire.”
National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan will meet with the families of the hostages at the White House on Monday, the senior official added.
The status of hostage negotiations came up during Biden’s call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday. On the call, Biden “made clear that everything must be done to secure the release of hostages, including American citizens, now held by Hamas terrorists for nearly six months.”
Biden and Netanyahu also discussed the importance of “fully empowering Israeli negotiators to reach a deal.”
CIA Director William Burns, Israel’s Mossad Director David Barnea and Shin Bet Director Ronen Bar will meet in Cairo this weekend, a source familiar with the talks and an Israeli government official source previously told CNN.
US is actively preparing for a significant regional attack by Iran that could come within the next week
From CNN's MJ Lee
The US is on high alert and actively preparing for a “significant” attack within the next week by Iran targeting Israeli or American assets in the region in response to Monday’s Israeli strike in Damascus that killed top Iranian commanders, a senior administration official tells CNN.
Senior US officials currently believe that an attack by Iran is “inevitable” – a view shared by their Israeli counterparts, that official said.
The two governments are furiously working to get in position ahead of what is to come, as they anticipate that Iran’s attack could unfold in a number of different ways – and that both US and Israeli assets and personnel are at risk of being targeted.
A forthcoming Iranian attack was a major topic of discussion on President Joe Biden’s phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.
As of Friday, the two governments did not know when or how Iran planned to strike back, the official said.
A direct strike on Israel by Iran is one of the worst-case scenarios that the Biden administration is bracing for, as it would guarantee rapid escalation of an already tumultuous situation in the Middle East.

US preparing for significant Iran attack on US or Israeli assets in the region as soon as next week
The US is on high alert and actively preparing for a “significant” attack that could come as soon as within the next week by Iran targeting Israeli or American assets in the region in response to Monday’s Israeli strike in Damascus that killed top Iranian commanders, a senior administration official tells CNN.
Senior US officials currently believe that an attack by Iran is “inevitable” – a view shared by their Israeli counterparts, that official said. The two governments are furiously working to get in position ahead of what is to come, as they anticipate that Iran’s attack could unfold in a number of different ways – and that both US and Israeli assets and personnel are at risk of being targeted.
A forthcoming Iranian attack was a major topic of discussion on President Joe Biden’s phone call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.
As of Friday, the two governments did not know when or how Iran planned to strike back, the official said.
A direct strike on Israel by Iran is one of the worst-case scenarios that the Biden administration is bracing for, as it would guarantee rapid escalation of an already tumultuous situation in the Middle East. Such a strike could lead to the Israel-Hamas war broadening into a wider, regional conflict – something Biden has long sought to avoid.
It has been two months since Iranian proxies attacked US forces in Iraq and Syria, a period of relative stability after months of drone, rocket and missile launches targeting US facilities. The lone exception came on Tuesday, when US forces shot down a drone near al-Tanf garrison in Syria. The drone attack, which the Defense Department said was carried out by Iranian proxies, came after the Israeli strike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus.
“We asses that al-Tanf was not the target of the drone,” a defense official said Tuesday. “Since we were unable to immediately determine the target and out of safety for US and coalition partners, the drone was shot down.”
The incident came after the Israeli airstrike on the Iranian embassy in Damascus on Monday, though an Israel Defense Forces spokesman told CNN that their intelligence showed the building was not a consulate and is instead “a military building of Quds forces disguised as a civilian building.”
Israel has carried out numerous strikes on Iran-backed targets in Syria, often targeting weapons shipments intended for Hezbollah, a powerful Iranian proxy in Lebanon. But the targeting of the embassy itself marks a significant escalation, since embassies are considered the sovereign territory of the nations they represent.
Iran vowed to take revenge after Israel’s airstrike on Iran’s embassy complex in Syria, which killed at least seven officials. Mohammed Reza Zahedi, a top commander in Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards (IRGC), and senior commander Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi were among those killed, according to Iran’s Foreign Ministry.
At least six Syrian citizens were also killed, Iranian state television reported on Tuesday.
Zahedi, a former commander of the IRGC’s ground forces, air force, and the deputy commander of its operations, is the most high-profile Iranian target killed since then-US President Donald Trump ordered the assassination of IRGC Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad in 2020.
The US was quick to inform Iran that the Biden administration was not involved and had no advance knowledge of Monday’s strike on the embassy and has warned Iran against coming after American assets.
“The United States had no involvement in the strike and we did not know about it ahead of time,” a National Security Council spokesperson told CNN earlier this week.
The US has warned Iran not to use the Israeli strike in Damascus as “a pretext to attack US personnel and facilities,” a State Department spokesperson told CNN Friday.
The warning was sent in response to a message from Iran, the spokesperson said. Iran’s message to the US blamed the US for the Damascus attack, a senior administration official said, though it was not clear what, if anything else, Iran conveyed to the US in that initial message.
The deputy chief of staff of the Iranian president, Mohammad Jamshidi, said on X Friday that “in a written message, the Islamic Republic of Iran warns US leadership not to get dragged in Netanyahu’s trap for US: Stay away so you won’t get hurt.” He added that in response, the US asked Iran not to target American facilities.
“As Iran noted publicly, we received a message from them,” the State Department spokesperson told CNN when asked about Jamshidi’s post. “We responded by warning Iran not to use this as a pretext to attack US personnel and facilities. We did not ‘ask.’”
A senior administration official described the US’ warning to Iran as: “Don’t think about coming after us.”
The State Department spokesperson did not provide further information about how the US’ message was conveyed to Iran.
The United States considers its own embassies and consulates abroad, as well as foreign countries’ embassies and consulates in the US, to have a special status. According to the US State Department, “an attack on an embassy is considered an attack on the country it represents.”
On Tuesday, the Pentagon’s Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the US’ assessment was that Israel had carried out the airstrike.
“That’s our assessment, and it’s also our assessment that there were a handful of IRGC top leaders there. I can’t confirm those identities, but that’s our initial assessment right now,” Singh said.
Israel has intensified its military campaign against Iran and its regional proxies following the October 7 attack on Israel by Tehran-backed Palestinian group Hamas, which killed about 1,200 people and saw more than 200 taken hostage.
Israel’s subsequent war in Gaza has killed more than 32,800 people, according to the Ministry of Health in the besieged enclave, wrought widespread destruction and brought more than 1 million people to the brink of a man-made famine.

US awaits Netanyahu’s response after Biden’s ultimatum
President Joe Biden put his own and America’s credibility on the line in trying to change how Israel is fighting in Gaza.
Now, he waits to see how far Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will yield to the most significant tonal and strategic shift by his administration since the start of the war.
If Netanyahu declines to take the “specific, concrete and measurable” steps in Gaza to ease civilian suffering and protect aid workers that Biden requested Thursday, the US president will face a critical choice. Is he prepared to allow Netanyahu to prolong his defiance on an issue that is creating a huge political risk in his reelection year with young, progressive and Arab American voters outraged over the war?

Biden to Netanyahu: Protect civilians or else
Or will Biden take the momentous step of conditioning the terms of US support for Israel in a war that was triggered by Hamas terror attacks in Israel that killed 1,200 people?
In one early sign that Biden’s message may be getting through, the Israeli security cabinet late Thursday approved steps including the reopening of the Erez crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip for the first time since the October 7 attacks, an Israeli official told CNN. The move could allow humanitarian aid to flow more easily into Gaza as famine looms.
But a sustained Israeli pivot will be needed in the days ahead – one that survives potential escalations in the war against Hamas – to ease criticism of Netanyahu and to mitigate Biden’s own domestic political exposure.
A high-stakes call between Biden and Netanyahu on Thursday followed the deaths of seven aid workers from World Central Kitchen in an Israeli strike in Gaza. The tragedy appeared to galvanize more outrage than the killing of what the Gaza health ministry says are more than 30,000 people in the enclave, where Hamas embeds its forces in civilian areas.
It was an important moment because for the first time, the US is raising the prospect of conditionality in its so-far staunch support for Israel, by warning that its policy on Gaza could change without swift action by Netanyahu. Biden also called for an “immediate ceasefire,” officials said.
“If we do not see changes we need to see, there will be changes in our policy,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said after the call. The administration did not lay out how the US stance could change, although prominent Democrats are now speaking openly about imposing limits on how the Israel Defense Forces can use weapons manufactured in the United States. Among them is Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, who is close to the president. The senator’s signal on Thursday that he was open to conditioning arms sales was the latest public statement by a senior Democrat that sounded like a warning to Biden that his political position is becoming unsustainable.
In Brussels on Friday, Blinken called for an “independent investigation” into the aid convoy strike, saying the US wanted to “see accountability” in the matter. Israel has said it believed it was targeting Hamas operatives and announced on Friday that two military commanders have been dismissed.
Despite repeatedly expressing its frustration with Israeli tactics, the White House has been unwilling or unable to impose any leverage on the prime minister. This fresh attempt to do so therefore crossed a significant line and if the new US push doesn’t deliver results, tensions between the allies are likely to become even more acute.
An attempt to ease political heat
Biden’s need to demonstrate to sectors of his Democratic coalition that he was imposing pressure on the Israelis, in a week when a Palestinian American physician walked out of a “listening session” on the war with the president, was evident in the way the administration presented the results of the call.
Blinken, who was in Brussels, held a televised press conference, speaking to Americans back home as well as US allies who have been far more ready to rebuke Israel for the conduct of the war than Biden. Then at the White House, National Security Communications Adviser John Kirby took up the baton, stressing that the US wanted to see changes from Israel – including the opening of more aid corridors into Gaza and measures to protect civilians – implemented straight away.
It’s unusual for an administration to brief a call with a foreign leader so fulsomely and publicly. Usually, the White House issues a statement offering few useful details of a conversation. This time, however, the administration was determined to control the narrative and defined what happened before Israel offered its own version of events. Biden didn’t appear before television cameras but posted a photo on X in which he stared pensively at a telephone during the call with a pen to his lips. “Israel must implement steps to address civilian harm and the safety of workers – and work toward a ceasefire to bring hostages home,” the president wrote. This coordinated public diplomacy underlined the gravity of a US shift. But it also increased the cost to Washington if Netanyahu doesn’t play along.
Leon Panetta, a former White House chief of staff, CIA director and defense secretary, told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday that he believed the administration’s drawing of a line with Israel could be effective and that it was important Biden called for a ceasefire. “This war has gone on for almost six months, and I think to some extent, I think President Biden and Netanyahu have been talking past each other when it comes to their concerns. I think that has changed. … I hope that has changed,” he said.
Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has been speaking out against Israel’s strategy in Gaza, said that American taxpayer dollars should not be “complicit” in allowing Israel to kill innocent people. “The bottom line, we are looking at one of the worst humanitarian disasters that we have seen in a very, very long time,” the Vermont senator told Tapper. “To my mind, Israel should not be getting another nickel in military aid until these policies are fundamentally changed,” Sanders said. “Hamas began this war, they are a terrorist organization, but the United States is not funding Hamas, we are funding Israel … what has got to be made clear to Israel is that you can go to war against Hamas, but you cannot continue these horrific actions.”
Netanyahu’s choice
Netanyahu, who has been in power for much of the last quarter century and is an extraordinary political survivor, has a long record of defying US pressure – one reason why dealing with him has been so treacherous for American presidents.
There was no immediate response from the prime minister, who held a cabinet meeting after the call that he used to warn that Israel will defend itself against Iran. The Islamic Republic issued warnings of retaliation after two senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers were killed in a strike in Damascus that the United States has attributed to Israel. The Israeli government put its forces on a state of high alert Thursday, and suspended leave for combat units. “We will know how to defend ourselves and we will act according to the simple principle of whoever harms us or plans to harm us, we will harm them,” Netanyahu said.
While the telephone call with Biden laid bare differences between the Israelis and the Americans, the administration also made a point of stressing that the US support for Israel’s security was inviolate. “They did talk about a very public and very viable real threat by Iran to Israel’s security,” Kirby said. Blinken, meanwhile, stressed that “President Biden reaffirmed the United States’ strong support for Israel in the face of these threats and our commitment to Israel’s security.”
Tensions have not been rising between the Israeli prime minister and Biden because of a personal disconnect. The two are veteran politicians who have known one another for years. Rather the president’s political interests – and arguably US national security interests – are diverging with those of Netanyahu. Biden has a strong incentive for the war to end, given the political blowback he is facing from within his fragile coalition in key states that will decide the 2024 election. Many Washington observers believe that Netanyahu has an incentive to prolong the conflict, given that an election is likely when the intensity of conflict cools. At that point, the focus will also turn to accountability for the worst terror attack in modern Israeli history and a period that is likely to be damning for Netanyahu, who presented himself to Israelis as the ultimate guarantor of their security.
One of the most notable features of Netanyahu’s strategy in recent months has been his unwillingness to pay even symbolic lip service to US needs given the political price that Biden is paying in return for his staunch support for Israel. On one hand, that is not surprising. For many Israelis, the horror of the October terror attacks and the depravity of an enemy that wants to wipe it off the map has overshadowed other considerations. Netanyahu, who has tracked far to the right over his career, also runs the most conservative government in Israeli history and is dependent on several extreme Orthodox parties to remain in power. The Israeli prime minister is a consummate Washington player and has been engaging with Biden’s Republican foes on Capitol Hill, in an alliance that could increase political complications for the president if he creates deeper fractures with the Israeli prime minister. Reinforcing the synergy between Netanyahu and the GOP, House Speaker Mike Johnson warned in a post on X, “The President’s ultimatums should be going to Hamas, not Israel.”
Still, Israel is becoming increasingly isolated internationally, and US support has rarely been so critical. Netanyahu would be taking a huge risk of his own if he openly defies public requests of a US president. A planned Israeli offensive in Rafah, which the US has warned must not go ahead until civilians are safeguarded, now looms as a potential breaking point between the two leaders.
If Biden eventually assesses his warnings are falling on deaf ears, his credibility will depend on him publicly imposing a cost on the Israeli prime minister. He will do so with a heavy heart, given his deep emotional bond with Israel.
But Biden’s political imperatives and the increasing humanitarian price of the war in Gaza mean he’s approaching a fateful crossroads. And now Netanyahu will decide which path he will take.

Israeli journalist explains why Netanyahu was ‘scared’ into acting fast after Biden talk

Despite mounting pressures, Netanyahu shows no signs of losing his grip on power
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s week began with the chants of thousands of protesters demanding a hostage deal and early elections outside the Knesset and his official residence. It ended with a scolding from US President Joe Biden over the Israeli military’s killing of seven humanitarian aid workers and the rapidly spiraling humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
In between, the Israeli prime minister’s chief political rival and war cabinet member raised his voice in support of early elections for the first time, ratcheting up the political pressure.
And yet, Netanyahu’s grip on power doesn’t appear to be in any imminent danger of slipping away.
Even as the walls appear to be closing in and a majority of Israelis continue to disapprove of Netanyahu’s performance, the mounting international and domestic political pressure has yet to fundamentally change the dynamics of his governing coalition – whose collapse would trigger new elections – nor his willingness to remain in office.
“I don’t think that there’s any leader in the world that faces so many fronts – has to cope with so many fronts – internal and external,” said Aviv Bushinsky, a former adviser to Netanyahu. “(But in Israel), we don’t talk about approval rating, we talk about the coalition.”

Netanyahu has repeatedly faced seemingly-certain political death during his decades-long career in politics, but has managed to survive and become Israel’s longest-serving prime minister in part by tending to the interests of allies in his governing coalition who will keep him in power.
“I had the privilege to lose the elections with Netanyahu in ’99. And for two years, we were working on his rehabilitation – the new Bibi at the time,” Bushinsky said. “The most fundamental thing that Netanyahu learned, it wasn’t a behavioral mistake. It was a political mistake. Never betray your natural allies, the other parties in the right wing.”
That concept has never been truer for Netanyahu than in this current governing coalition, the most right-wing in Israel’s history. And even as Netanyahu faces a slew of political headwinds, none of the members of that governing coalition, or of his own party, have indicated any serious intent of leaving the government and triggering its collapse.
A bruhaha over whether ultra-Orthodox Jews should be conscripted into the Israeli military has recently presented a new threat to his coalition, given the diverging interests of key members of his Likud party and ultra-Orthodox parties in his coalition. But Israeli political analysts now estimate it will likely be months before the issue comes to a head and presents any real threat to his government.
Netanyahu is facing mounting public displays of discontent, from the families of Israeli hostages as well as the growing number of people taking to the streets of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem to demand new elections. But while their numbers are growing, the protests have yet to come close to matching the scale of the protests opposing his judicial reform plans before the war.
Former Defense Minister Benny Gantz, Netanyahu’s top political foe who joined the wartime unity government days into the war, is beginning to do his part to turn up the heat on Netanyahu. For the first time this week, he called for early elections as soon as September, ahead of the 1-year anniversary of the war, framing such a vote as essential to preserving the wartime unity that his presence in the emergency government has helped deliver.
“I believe that the Israeli society needs to renew its contract with its leadership,” Gantz said this week. “And I think the only way to do it and still maintain the national effort in fighting Hamas and terrorist groups and other security challenges is by having an agreed election date, that we have to discuss when and if. And I hope that my political partners and friends, and maybe some rivals as well, will agree to it because I think it serves all the country and all its sectors at the same time.”
Netanyahu has yet to publicly address Gantz’s demand and no members of Netanyahu’s coalition have indicated a desire to help turn Gantz’s call into reality by triggering new elections.
Gantz stands the most to gain with new elections, with Israeli polls indicating his party would win the most seats in the Knesset – giving him a mandate to form a new government.
His departure from the war cabinet would not trigger new elections because he is not a member of the 64-member governing coalition that gives Netanayahu a majority in the 120-seat Knesset. But a Gantz departure from the government could shatter the image of wartime unity that has already begun to fray.

“Breaking the image of unity might be something very harmful for the for the government, because you will see more demonstrations in the streets and you cannot be indifferent to the demonstrations, even if you are 100 years in power,” Bushinsky said.
As for the growing criticism of Netanyahu from the Biden White House and its allies?
On the one hand, it is undermining a key attribute for any Israeli prime minister: a need to maintain a strong relationship with Israel’s most important ally, especially in wartime. But on the other, the criticism has given Netanyahu an opportunity to showcase his characteristic defiance, positioning himself as a defender of a war effort that the overwhelming majority of Israelis continue to support.
“The criticism and the pressure that is being implemented or imposed on Israel? Now, it suits Netanyahu. Because this is another way that Netanyahu can show his constituency that he’s a very strong leader and no one can manipulate him,” Bushinsky said. “The more you squeeze Netanyahu, the more firm Netanyahu… shows that he is strong.”

Opinion: 6 months since October 7, there are no winners here
Editor’s Note: Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.
Almost exactly six months ago, Israelis awoke to a nightmare. Civilians in the southern part of the country, areas near the border with Gaza, were under a brutal, ongoing attack. It would become the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust and a prelude to unspeakable suffering on both sides of the border.
Six months after Hamas launched that deadly rampage, knowing that Israel’s response would be ferocious, there are only losers in this terrible war.
It’s hard now to find many winners with the death toll mounting among Gazans and hunger growing in the strip. And with Israeli hostages still held captive, perhaps in dank Hamas tunnels.
For Hamas, the fact that war continues may count as a victory, but thousands of Hamas’ fighters — the exact number is disputed — have been killed. Hamas may be decimated, perhaps unable to hold on to power, but that’s no victory for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under growing global pressure and besieged by protesters at home, and whose legacy will be forever darkened.

Even US President Joe Biden has paid a price, caught in an election-year political vise between those who think he is too supportive of Israel and those who think he has been too critical.
The strife has also detonated a worldwide explosion of antisemitism, reviving a hatred that had lain lightly dormant. It’s causing anxiety across Europe, and leading some American Jews to conclude that one country where they had felt safe is no longer a haven, as they face antisemitism from the left and the right. Anti-Muslim bigotry has also increased.
This awful chapter started on October 7 last year, when Hamas terrorists breached what was supposed to be a secure border and slaughtered Israelis in their beds, in their living rooms, in their cars, at an outdoor music festival and bus shelters and parks.
They raped countless women with horrifying brutality.
Israeli security forces were nowhere to be found for hours. Hamas — the Iran-allied group that rules Gaza — killed more than 1,200 Israelis and dragged back hundreds more as hostages. The area lay in ruins. Israelis’ sense of security had been shattered.
Today, it is Gaza that lies in ruins, tens of thousands of Palestinians killed by Israel in its quest to uproot and destroy Hamas. As Israel crushes Gaza, its global reputation is getting shattered. But still the IDF believes around 100 Israeli hostages remain captive of Hamas and other militants in conditions that one shudders to imagine.
CNN's Melissa Bell speaks with Yechiel Yehud, the father of two hostages that are still trapped in Gaza. He details his worries, his heartbreak and his hope for the future.

The father of two Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza shares his story
This week’s Israeli strike on a World Central Kitchen (WCK) convoy, killing seven aid workers, adds to the calamity of this convulsion in the perennially unstable crossroads of the Middle East. Amid the outrage and heartbreak, WCK’s founder, celebrity chef José Andrés, accuses Israel of targeting his staff. Israel has apologized, saying the convoy was misidentified. Israel has fired two officers and reprimanded senior commanders after an inquiry into the strike.
There was never any question that Israel would respond to October 7. It had been attacked by a group that promised it would repeat the massacre of Israelis and is backed by Iran, a country whose leaders have vowed to destroy Israel. The attack led some there to conclude that whatever price Israel should pay for absolute victory — including in global public opinion — it is worth paying. Besides, the attackers kidnapped hundreds of its citizens, including women, children and the elderly. Israel needed to save them.
In the immediate aftermath, world leaders expressed support for Israel. But when the death toll in Gaza starting climbing, as Hamas knew it would, international support for Israel turned to withering criticism. In the most painful irony of all, Israel — the country that became home to Holocaust survivors, under attack by a group whose original charter outlined a genocidal ideology and a vow to destroy Israel — was itself perversely accused of genocide.

Biden to Netanyahu: Protect civilians or else
As always, the greatest suffering, the biggest losers, have been civilians on both sides. Palestinians in Gaza are enduring a living nightmare. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 30,000 have been killed in the conflict. The figures don’t distinguish between combatants and civilians, but there’s little doubt that horrifyingly large numbers of them, including children, have been killed. The territory is a wasteland.
Gazans are caught between the cynicism of Hamas, the geopolitical concerns of their Arab neighbors and Israel’s determination to win at any cost. Hamas leaders, comfortable in exile, proclaimed early on that they are “proud to sacrifice martyrs.” Hamas fighters embedded themselves in Gaza’s population, including in hospitals, essentially daring Israel to kill civilians to get to them.
In most wars, civilians would have been allowed to flee the fighting, but the people of Gaza were not allowed to leave the territory whether they wanted to or not. Hamas urged them to stay. Egypt, worried about whether Israel would allow the people to return and concerned about instability on its soil, closed its border to all but a small number of Palestinian civilians.
The cruel fact is that the lives of Palestinians have not been the highest priority for anyone in this war.
Complicating the situation is the political crisis in Israel, which preceded the October 7 attack. Netanyahu — a political survivor who faces corruption charges — already presided over the most right-wing government in Israel’s history. Before the war, tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in nearly 10 months of weekly protests against a plan that would have severely weakened Israeli democracy by stripping the Supreme Court of much of its power.
Netanyahu was, in my view and others’, already the worst prime minister in Israel’s history even before October 7.
Polls have found that most Israelis want him gone. Now Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet but also the leading opposition figure before the war, has called for new elections in September. Recent polling says say he’s Netanyahu’s most likely successor.

Devastation in Gaza as Israel wages war on Hamas
The fact that Netanyahu is heading the government during one of the most dangerous, most damaging times in Israel’s history only adds to the disturbing nature of this conflict. Israel is not in good hands.
Would another leader, a different government, have been able to conduct the war with fewer civilian deaths, with less damage to Israel’s global standing, without eroding the vital relationship between Israel and the United States? I suspect the answer is yes.
If there’s any glimmer of hope in this dispiriting landscape it is that the young Abraham Accords — which normalized relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors — have survived the toughest of stress tests. That augurs well for the long run, for more stability of the region, eventually.
It opens the door to the possibility that once this war is over, once the post-war phase — whatever that looks like — also comes to an end, there could be a new architecture that leads to peace. For that to happen, however, two of the many losing protagonists in this conflict, Hamas and Netanyahu, cannot remain in power.

Far from the wrangling of diplomats and just below the incessant buzzing of Israeli drones, millions of Palestinians languish in destroyed homes and makeshift tents across Gaza.
They are cold, hungry, terrified and growing increasingly frustrated with the international communityâs inability to broker a permanent ceasefire in the brutal, asymmetric fight between Israel and Hamas.
In the six months since Hamasâ deadly October 7 attack, Israel has launched a bombing campaign and ground offensive in Gaza that has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health. It also has imposed a siege and razed entire communities, rendering nearly 90% of the population displaced and 100% food insecure.
Israel says its military tactics are necessary to defeat Hamas. The International Court of Justice says itâs âplausibleâ that Israel is committing genocide, though a final ruling in the case could take years. Israel strongly rejects the allegation.
With many local journalists killed, and Gaza all but closed to foreign press, one of the few ways to hear directly from Palestinians is through voice notes, sent whenever internet connection is briefly available.
The voice notes for this project, collected between December and February, provide a small window into the physical and psychological toll the war has taken on the people of Gaza.

MESSAGES TO THE WORLD
Each person who sent CNN a voice note included a message addressed to the international community.
Fatima Osama Mohammed Abu-Saffia
Pregnant mother
The message Iâm sending to the world is that anyone who can intervene, please save us from the situation weâre in. Itâs so bad that itâs difficult to even describe. What youâre seeing in photos or on TV, itâs not like what weâre really experiencing at all. It doesnât even come close. We want an end to this, in any way possible. For the sake of humanity, end the war.
Raghad Abu Hejier
Second grader
My message to the world is that I hope the war ends and I can go back to my house to play and live the rest of my life like other kids.
Ali Jebril
Wheelchair basketball player
Iâm not okay and neither is my family, which has four people with disabilities. And neither are my married siblings nor the rest of our family of 45 people, including children, women, men â they are not okay. I want protection. I want to leave Gaza so I can live in peace and safety, and so I can have a future.
Ghada Al Kurd
Freelance journalist
The message I want to send all over the world is that you have to see the people of Gaza, the civilian people. You have to see their suffering. You have to believe in their right to live and right to have a good life without any problems. They want peace, they donât want any other war anymore. Itâs enough for them, every two years, every three years, a war. They lost hope. They became displaced. They are desperate, frustrated, they want to live a good life.
Afaf AlNajjar
University student
We are as much human as anyone else in the world. And we have dreams, and we have ambitions, and we have things that we want to accomplish. And we have stories that we want to tell just like everybody else. And we feel pain. We feel pain just like everybody else.
Farida Adel Algoul
English teacher
I lost my loved ones. I lost a lot of my family. I lost myself during this war. Itâs not a war. Itâs a genocide. â¦ My question to this world: How many Palestinians should lose their life to stop this genocidal war against us? How many?
Israa Ahmed
Doctor
I want us to live in safety, peace and good health. We want to live with dignity and freedom in our homeland. We want our whole country, from the north to the south, without occupation. ... There is nothing we can say to the world when they have already seen everything. They saw the genocide with their own eyes, but they still support the Israeli occupation. America is still supporting Israel and still providing them with aid to bomb us.
Nour Shaer
Medical student
You need to pressure your governments to stop this. A ceasefire. We need a ceasefire. You need to stand with us. You need to stand with everyone in Gaza because we need your support.
Raâeesa Dery
Cancer patient
I want my voice to reach the whole world: Stop the war on the Palestinian people. Enough death. Enough displacement. Enough bloodshed. Enough horror. Enough.

Northeast earthquake
Rare 4.8 magnitude quake rattles Northeast
By Elise Hammond, Leinz Vales and Matt Meyer, CNN
What we covered here
Our live coverage is over for today. Please scroll below for all the news about the quake that rattled the US Northeast region on Friday.
4.0 magnitude aftershock recorded in New Jersey, USGS says
From CNN's Brandon Miller
An aftershock of a preliminary magnitude 4.0 has struck just southwest of Gladstone, New Jersey, according to the United States Geological Survey.
It happened at about 5:59 p.m. ET, USGS said.
The aftershock comes nearly 8 hours after the main shock of 4.8 magnitude this morning. There have been at least 10 aftershocks, though most were in the 1.8 to 2.2 magnitude range.
No injuries or major damage in Northeast after morning quake in New Jersey. What to know to get caught up
From CNN staff
A 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattled buildings across parts of the US Northeast on Friday morning, according to the US Geological Survey, with tremors felt from Washington, DC to New York City and to Maine.
It was the third-largest earthquake recorded in the area in the last five decades and the strongest in New Jersey in more than 240 years, the USGS said. But with authorities reporting little or no damage, and minimal travel disruptions, people soon resumed their everyday lives.
Here's what to know:
Amtrak trains resume running at normal speeds
From CNN's Pete Muntean
Amtrak trains are back to operating at normal speeds after an earthquake in New Jersey on Friday, the company said.
It said it started inspecting its tracks shortly after 11 a.m. ET, and put speed restrictions in place throughout the region. Amtrak said it has now completed those inspections.
“As of 3:30 PM ET, All inspections have been completed and service has been restored to normal speed. Residual delays should be expected,” Amtrak posted on X.
At least 6 aftershocks recorded following New Jersey earthquake, USGS reports
From CNN’s Samantha Beech, Brandon Miller and Taylor Ward
There have been at least six aftershocks in the hours following the New Jersey earthquake Friday morning, according to United States Geological Survey data.
The initial earthquake was felt in northern New Jersey just before 10:30 a.m. ET, and the aftershocks were all recorded in the immediate area of the earthquake, USGS said.
According to USGS, the largest of the six aftershocks was 2.2 magnitude, recorded just after 1:30 p.m. ET.
Here's a timeline (all times are ET):
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a social media post that "aftershocks of these size are normal and are not expected to cause further damage."
The governor said there have been no reports of injuries or damage.
See how people in the Northeast reacted when the earthquake hit
From CNN's Jeremy Moorhead and Sean Clark
When an earthquake rattled buildings across the Northeast Friday morning, stunned residents described initially thinking a passing tractor-trailer or freight train was passing them before they realized it was something more.
There were reports of the 4.8 magnitude quake being felt from Philadelphia to New York City, according to the US Geological Survey.
See how some people reacted:
3 neighboring homes in New Jersey evacuated after reporting structural damage, offical says
From CNN’s Nic F. Anderson and David Goldman
Three neighboring homes in Newark, New Jersey, have been evacuated after residents reported structural damage following this morning’s earthquake, according to the local public safety director.
Newark Public Safety Director Fritz Fragé told CNN no injuries have been reported after firefighters responded to reports of damage at the homes in an area more than 30 miles from the earthquake’s epicenter.
He said 10 families were relocated from the buildings, including 25 adults and three children.
Fragé added that all Newark city buildings, including City Hall and recreation centers, are closed. He said the city is inspecting buildings for any potential damage and power outages.
Also in New Jersey’s Essex County, in Montclair, officials believe the earthquake caused a water main break, according to an update from the Office of Emergency Management for the Township of Montclair. The OEM said the water bureau is working to repair the line.
The Montclair OEM said authorities have conducted a damage assessment of the township and there are no signs of damage to the infrastructure and all schools and municipal properties report no damage.
Today's earthquake was the strongest in New Jersey in more than 240 years
From CNN's Elliana Hebert, Sara Tonks and Eric Zerkel
The rare 4.8 earthquake that struck northern New Jersey Friday was the third-strongest to strike the state, according to CNN analysis of US Geological Survey data.
The Friday morning earthquake also marked the strongest since 1783, more than 240 years ago. Two 5.1 magnitude temblors are the only stronger quakes in the state — one in 1755 and another in 1783. Both happened before New Jersey became a state in December 1787, but happened in the geographic area that now comprises the state's boundaries.
The quake is the third-strongest to hit the Northeast in 50 years and the 10th-strongest of all time in the region, USGS data shows.
Earthquakes in New Jersey and the region are rare. There have only been 24 earthquakes of 2.5 magnitude or greater in New Jersey since 1700.
All aspects of New York City transit system operating safely after earthquake, MTA chief says
From CNN's Samantha Beech
All aspects of the New York City transit system are operating safely following this morning’s earthquake, the Metropolitan Transport Authority, which runs the city's subway and other forms of public transit, said.
MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said every part of the transit system operated safely during the earthquake, as well.
He said initial facility inspections have been completed, including inspections of the seven bridges the MTA operate.
“I want to emphasize those were designed to withstand much stronger seismic impact than we experienced today,” he added.
According to the MTA website, MTA Bridges and Tunnels (B&T) serves more than 900,000 vehicles on an average day. In 2019, it carried more traffic than any bridge and tunnel authority in the nation — more than 329 million vehicles, the MTA says.
Lieber said MTA frontline staff have been directed to report any abnormalities in the system, but he said nothing had been flagged so far.
There's a low likelihood of aftershocks following today's quake, New York City's emergency chief says
From CNN staff
There is a low likelihood of aftershocks following Friday's 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled several Northeast cities, New York City Emergency Management Commissioner Zachary Iscol said.
Iscol, however, urged New Yorkers to remain vigilant.
“If you are outside during an aftershock, please move to an open area, away from buildings, trees and power lines. If you are driving, pull over to a safe location," he said at a news conference Friday alongside New York City Mayor Eric Adams.
Iscol said there were no major impacts or safety events related to the earthquake, and added that New Yorkers can call 311 to report any damage.
The quake, he said, triggered the activation of the city's emergency response teams and prompted officials to issue guidance to the public.
“We activated our protocols for this earthquake, we immediately began coordinating with all city, state, federal and our utility partners. Public notifications were sent out both by Notify NYC and our wireless emergency alert system,” he said.

“As of 3:30 PM ET, All inspections have been completed and service has been restored to normal speed. Residual delays should be expected,” Amtrak posted on X.

From CNN’s Samantha Beech, Brandon Miller and Taylor Ward
There have been at least six aftershocks in the hours following the New Jersey earthquake Friday morning, according to United States Geological Survey data.
The initial earthquake was felt in northern New Jersey just before 10:30 a.m. ET, and the aftershocks were all recorded in the immediate area of the earthquake, USGS said.
According to USGS, the largest of the six aftershocks was 2.2 magnitude, recorded just after 1:30 p.m. ET.
Here's a timeline (all times are ET):
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said in a social media post that "aftershocks of these size are normal and are not expected to cause further damage."
The governor said there have been no reports of injuries or damage.

3 neighboring homes in New Jersey evacuated after reporting structural damage, offical says
From CNN’s Nic F. Anderson and David Goldman
Three neighboring homes in Newark, New Jersey, have been evacuated after residents reported structural damage following this morning’s earthquake, according to the local public safety director.
Newark Public Safety Director Fritz Fragé told CNN no injuries have been reported after firefighters responded to reports of damage at the homes in an area more than 30 miles from the earthquake’s epicenter.
He said 10 families were relocated from the buildings, including 25 adults and three children.
Fragé added that all Newark city buildings, including City Hall and recreation centers, are closed. He said the city is inspecting buildings for any potential damage and power outages.
Also in New Jersey’s Essex County, in Montclair, officials believe the earthquake caused a water main break, according to an update from the Office of Emergency Management for the Township of Montclair. The OEM said the water bureau is working to repair the line.
The Montclair OEM said authorities have conducted a damage assessment of the township and there are no signs of damage to the infrastructure and all schools and municipal properties report no damage.
Today's earthquake was the strongest in New Jersey in more than 240 years
From CNN's Elliana Hebert, Sara Tonks and Eric Zerkel
The rare 4.8 earthquake that struck northern New Jersey Friday was the third-strongest to strike the state, according to CNN analysis of US Geological Survey data.
The Friday morning earthquake also marked the strongest since 1783, more than 240 years ago. Two 5.1 magnitude temblors are the only stronger quakes in the state — one in 1755 and another in 1783. Both happened before New Jersey became a state in December 1787, but happened in the geographic area that now comprises the state's boundaries.
The quake is the third-strongest to hit the Northeast in 50 years and the 10th-strongest of all time in the region, USGS data shows.
Earthquakes in New Jersey and the region are rare. There have only been 24 earthquakes of 2.5 magnitude or greater in New Jersey since 1700.
All aspects of New York City transit system operating safely after earthquake, MTA chief says
From CNN's Samantha Beech
All aspects of the New York City transit system are operating safely following this morning’s earthquake, the Metropolitan Transport Authority, which runs the city's subway and other forms of public transit, said.
MTA Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said every part of the transit system operated safely during the earthquake, as well.
He said initial facility inspections have been completed, including inspections of the seven bridges the MTA operate.
“I want to emphasize those were designed to withstand much stronger seismic impact than we experienced today,” he added.
According to the MTA website, MTA Bridges and Tunnels (B&T) serves more than 900,000 vehicles on an average day. In 2019, it carried more traffic than any bridge and tunnel authority in the nation — more than 329 million vehicles, the MTA says.
Lieber said MTA frontline staff have been directed to report any abnormalities in the system, but he said nothing had been flagged so far.
There's a low likelihood of aftershocks following today's quake, New York City's emergency chief says
From CNN staff
There is a low likelihood of aftershocks following Friday's 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled several Northeast cities, New York City Emergency Management Commissioner Zachary Iscol said.
Iscol, however, urged New Yorkers to remain vigilant.
“If you are outside during an aftershock, please move to an open area, away from buildings, trees and power lines. If you are driving, pull over to a safe location," he said at a news conference Friday alongside New York City Mayor Eric Adams.
Iscol said there were no major impacts or safety events related to the earthquake, and added that New Yorkers can call 311 to report any damage.
The quake, he said, triggered the activation of the city's emergency response teams and prompted officials to issue guidance to the public.
“We activated our protocols for this earthquake, we immediately began coordinating with all city, state, federal and our utility partners. Public notifications were sent out both by Notify NYC and our wireless emergency alert system,” he said.

Aftershocks rattle Northeast after rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake hits region
A 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattled buildings across parts of the Northeast Friday morning, according to the US Geological Survey, with tremors felt from Washington, DC to New York City to Maine.
It was the third largest earthquake recorded in the area in the last five decades and the strongest in New Jersey in more than 240 years, the USGS said. The rare quake was felt by millions of people across hundreds of miles, disrupting work and school life and jolting nerves momentarily before an early spring day seemed to return to normal.
In a region unaccustomed to earthquakes, stunned residents across large swaths of the Northeast described initially thinking of a passing tractor trailer or freight train before realizing it was something more. With authorities reporting little or no damage, and minimal travel disruptions, people soon resumed their everyday lives.
“At first I thought it was a big truck driving down a nearby road or the oil burner shaking inside my house,” said Jeanne Evola, who described her whole house shaking in Franklin Square on Long Island.
She ran outside as the quake intensified. She found her neighbors describing the same rattling, realizing they had experienced an earthquake in a suburb about 20 miles east of New York City.
The New York Police Department said there were no damages or injuries reported.
“New Yorkers should go about their normal day,” New York Mayor Eric Adams said at a news briefing later Friday.
There have been at least 11 aftershocks since the quake, the latest a 4.0 magnitude recorded southwest of Gladstone, 20 minutes from the epicenter, at 5:59 p.m., according to USGS.
USGS said the initial earthquake occurred at 10:23 a.m. The New York City Fire Department said the department received reports of shaking buildings about 10:30 a.m.
“We are responding to calls and evaluating structural stability,” the department said in a statement. “There are no major incidents at this time.”
In some parts of the New York City area, startled residents spilled out from tenements and row houses onto the sidewalks in front of their buildings in the minutes after the shaking stopped.
“Everything started vibrating then I felt the building shake,” said David Rodriguez, a resident of Hoboken, New Jersey. “I thought it was a large truck outside until everything started swaying. But it had that sound of something swaying from side to side.”
The X account for the Empire State Building posted: “I AM FINE.”
Long after the quake subsided, residents were startled anew by loud emergency alerts on their mobile phones. At 11:46 a.m. came another alert, this one warning of potential aftershocks. Addressing the delay, a city emergency management official called an earthquake “a no notice event” and said authorities had to confirm the information they were receiving.
“New Yorkers are not accustomed to having earthquakes in our state,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters. “Everyone should continue to take this seriously.”
NYC Department of Buildings Commissioner James Oddo asked for the “cooperation” of construction professionals for reports of damage to the city’s 1.1 million buildings.

In New Jersey’s Hunterdon County, where Lebanon Township is located, there were no reports of injuries or evacuations in the area around the epicenter, according to county officials.
The Board of County Commissioners said a damage assessment was underway and officials were beginning to receive reports of structural issues in buildings.
Three neighboring homes in Newark, New Jersey, were evacuated after residents reported structural damage, according to the city’s public safety director.
No injuries were reported but firefighters responded to calls about structural damage in the three buildings, more than 30 miles from where the quake originated, according to Newark Public Safety Director Fritz Fragé.
Ten families – 25 adults and three children – were relocated, he said.
All Newark city buildings were closed. Fragé said the city was inspecting buildings for damage and power outages.
In New Jersey’s Essex County, the quake is believed to have caused a water main break, according to the Office of Emergency Management of the Township of Montclair.
In Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Police Department received more than 200 calls “in a very short period of 20 minutes” after the quake, Commissioner Kevin J. Bethel said. The calls overloaded the system.
“We were able to get our call base back down within 30 minutes,” Bethel said.
‘Good quality New York moment’
More than 23 million people felt “light shaking,” which is felt by most people and can cause cars to rock noticeably and cause a sensation like a truck striking a building, according to the USGS.
About 9,000 people felt “strong shaking,” which is described by the USGS as “felt by all” and can move heavy furniture and cause slight damage. This would occur closest to the epicenter near Lebanon, New Jersey. And nearly 300,000 people felt “moderate shaking,” which could be strong enough to break windows or cause dishes to fall.
Reed Whitmont, who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, was sitting in bed inside his old apartment building when everything started shaking. Then the cat bolted.
“It went on for about a minute, then I stuck my head out the window and all the neighbors were shouting and asking each other if they felt that too. Good quality New York moment.”
In Jersey City, New Jersey, Kristina Fiore was sitting at her desk in her apartment when her building shook for a few seconds.
In video from inside the home, objects rattled as a cat runs away. “It’s okay. It’s an earthquake!: Fiore is heard saying. At first Fiore thought there was an explosion at a nearby metal recycling plant, but the shaking got stronger. “I said out loud, ‘It’s an earthquake’ because I could tell that my 5-year-old was worried about what was happening. Also my cats were really freaking out. They were scared and confused for like an hour after the quake.”
At the Boonton Coffee Co. shop in Boonton, New Jersey, a video shared on social media showed customers running out of the store in confusion when the building started shaking. Some people are heard panicking. Others continued ordering with their barista.
The light shaking would be unlikely to cause damage, per initial data indications from the USGS. Initial reports indicated a 4.8 magnitude quake, but that was revised to 4.7 before being adjusted back to 4.8. This could change again as more data is reviewed.
The epicenter was just northeast of Lebanon, New Jersey, less than 50 miles west of New York City, according to the USGS.
The light quake was shallow, just below the surface at 5 km depth, which made it easier for residents in affected areas to feel the shaking. Initial reports indicate shaking was widely felt in New York City, Philadelphia and Washington, DC.
Some air and train travel affected
The USGS said a number of factors influenced the amount of places where the quake was felt, including the geology of the region itself.
The earthquake was on the extreme end of what the USGS considers a shallow earthquake: 0 to 70 km deep. The energy released by an earthquake is blunted by distance, so a shallower quake of the same magnitude as a deeper one will produce much more intense shaking at the surface.
The rocks that make up the Earth’s crust and mantle in the eastern US are much older, denser and harder – compressed by time – than they are in the West, according to the USGS. This makes them more efficient conduits of the seismic energy released by an earthquake, allowing it to travel in a more potent form over longer distances.
Buildings are also older in the Northeast and may not be designed to the latest earthquake code, the USGS said. This is particularly a concern for shorter buildings like houses. Earthquakes tend to shake in a faster back-and-forth motion in the East compared to the West, which puts smaller buildings more at risk for damage, the USGS noted.
The earthquake affected some air and train travel in the Northeast.
Flights to the New York Kennedy, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Newark airports were initially held, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.
The air traffic control tower at Newark Liberty airport was being evacuated, a controller said in a radio transmission after the earthquake, meaning flights were being held while controllers moved to an alternate location.
”Nobody’s going to go anywhere for the time being,” a controller said over the radio frequency.
The runways were in the process of being inspected for damage.
At noon the FAA reported a ground stop remained in effect at Newark, and the controllers were relocating back to the tower.
Amtrak reported train service was slowed after the earthquake so track inspections could be performed.
“As of 3:30 PM ET, All inspections have been completed and service has been restored to normal speed. Residual delays should be expected,” Amtrak posted on X.

Trump suffers setbacks in efforts to shut down two of the criminal cases against him
Former President Donald Trump was dealt two major setbacks Thursday in his efforts to derail the criminal cases against him, with judges in the Georgia election interference case and in the federal classified documents case both rejecting bids by the presumptive 2024 GOP presidential nominee to have those cases thrown out.
The judges in both cases have yet to decide other requests put forward by Trump seeking the dismissal of the Georgia and federal prosecutions, which were brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis and special counsel Jack Smith, respectively. But for now, the prospect of the cases eventually going before juries remains alive, and a trial in a third criminal prosecution against Trump – the 2016 campaign hush money case brought in New York – is on track to start this month.

Trump is trying everything he can to delay this month’s hush money criminal trial
The New York case aside, the likelihood that the other prosecutions against Trump – which also include a federal election subversion case brought in Washington, DC, by the special counsel – will go to trial before the November election is very much still in the air. Delay has been a key part of the former president’s strategy, and he has had considerable success in prolonging the pretrial litigation in the prosecutions against him. The DC case, which at one point was moving the most quickly among all the Trump criminal cases, is now on hold while the Supreme Court considers whether Trump’s status as a former president grants him immunity from those criminal charges. Those arguments are scheduled for this month.
Trump has made similar presidential immunity arguments in the Georgia case and in the classified documents case. He has pleaded not guilty in all four criminal cases.
In the classified documents case, which is proceeding in south Florida, US District Judge Aileen Cannon on Thursday declined Trump’s request that she dismiss the case based on his arguments that he had the authority to take classified or sensitive documents with him after he left the White House.
Cannon’s short order, however, kept open the possibility that Trump could still use the argument to defend himself at trial or could bring it up in other pre-trial proceedings.
The judge, a Trump appointee, didn’t detail her views on the claims Trump was making, based on a law called the Presidential Records Act, but said Trump’s attorneys did not meet the legal standard to dismiss charges.
She wrote that prosecutors “make no reference to the Presidential Records Act” in the indictment against Trump and did not “rely” on the statute to bring charges.
Cannon also used the order to push back on a request by the special counsel she make a final ruling on whether the theory could be incorporated into the jury instructions of an eventual trial, so that prosecutors could appeal such a ruling to the 11th Circuit. She said that “demand” was “unprecedented and unjust.”
There are still more than a dozen outstanding motions for Cannon to decide, including several other motions to dismiss the case.
Georgia election subversion case judge rejects Trump’s free speech arguments
In the Georgia election subversion case, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee rejected the argument that Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election were protected under the First Amendment.
“The defense has not presented, nor is the Court able to find, any authority that the speech and conduct alleged is protected political speech,” the Atlanta-area judge wrote in his order.
McAfee’s ruling is the latest step inching the state racketeering case against Trump forward. Willis has suggested she would be ready to go to trial as soon as August, but the judge has still not set a trial date for Trump or his remaining 14 co-defendants in the Peach State.
The decision comes as some of Trump’s fellow defendants consider seeking a gag order against Willis after she has made public comments about the case.
McAfee’s refusal to scrap the indictment comes as the free speech defense has repeatedly fallen short in pretrial wrangling in election meddling cases.
“After interpreting the indictment’s language liberally in favor of the State as required at this pretrial stage, the Court finds that the Defendants’ expressions and speech are alleged to have been made in furtherance of criminal activity and constitute false statements knowingly and willfully made in matters within a government agency’s jurisdiction which threaten to deceive and harm the government,” McAfee wrote in his order issued Thursday.
McAfee previously rejected similar First Amendment challenges from other defendants in the Georgia case. In the federal election interference case brought in Washington, DC, by the special counsel, Judge Tanya Chutkan also heard – and rejected – the argument that Trump’s actions should be considered protected political speech.
The Fulton County district attorney’s office declined to comment on Thursday’s order from McAfee.
Trump’s Georgia lawyer Steve Sadow said in a statement that Trump and other defendants “respectfully disagree” with the ruling and will explore their options.
“It is significant that the court’s ruling made clear that defendants were not foreclosed from again raising their ‘as-applied challenges at the appropriate time after the establishment of a factual record,’” Sadow’s statement read.
Cannon defends her approach
While the new order from Cannon in the federal classified documents case was a loss for Trump, prosecutors were also rebuffed in their request for more clarity from the judge about how she views the Presidential Records Act in the context of the case.
Smith made the request when Cannon ordered both sides to submit hypothetical jury instructions that would take into account Trump’s claims of sweeping record-retention authority.
Cannon defended that exercise in Thursday’s order, saying it should not “be interpreted as anything other than what it was: a genuine attempt, in the context of the upcoming trial, to better understand the parties’ competing positions and the questions to be submitted to the jury in this complex case of first impression.”
The post-Watergate PRA governs how records are handled after an administration ends, including the turnover of presidential records to the National Archives. Trump has claimed that under the law, he had the ultimate authority to decide which documents are his personal records that he’s allowed to keep in his possession.
Prosecutors have maintained that the PRA is not relevant to the charges. In court filings, they argued Trump’s theory that the law allowed him to designate the classified records as his personal documents was a “fiction” invented many months after he let office.
Cannon said Thursday that her requests for jury instructions “should not be misconstrued as declaring a final definition on any essential element or asserted defense in this case.”

CIA refutes whistleblower claim pushed by Republicans leading Biden impeachment inquiry
House Republicans leading the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden were dealt their latest blow this week when the CIA informed them that an allegation they pushed was false, the latest example of House Republicans citing questionable information to make a serious claim.
Without the evidence or the votes to impeach the president, at this point there is no clear consensus on how – or even when – to end the Republican-led impeachment inquiry. This latest development comes after the Department of Justice charged a once trusted FBI informant with lying about the president and his son Hunter Biden’s involvement in business dealings, undercutting a major aspect of Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into the president.
House Oversight Chair James Comer and House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan accused the CIA ﻿in a letter last month of intervening in the criminal investigation into Hunter Biden by preventing IRS and DOJ investigators from interviewing a witness in their probe, based on information they say came from a whistleblower.
But the CIA has refuted that claim in a letter obtained first by CNN that was sent to Jordan and Comer.
“Without confirming or denying the existence of any associations or communications, CIA did not prevent or seek to prevent IRS or DOJ from conducting any such interview. The allegation is false,” CIA Director of Congressional Affairs James A. Catella wrote to the Republican Committee Chairs.
House Republicans are pushing back on the refutation. “The allegation is not false,” House Judiciary Committee spokesman Russell Dye told CNN. A Republican House Oversight Committee spokesperson told CNN the same thing.
The top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, Rep. Jamie Raskin, said Republicans have not shared where they got the evidence to make this accusation to the CIA in the first place.
“This is a serious charge, but you have completely ignored my staff’s requests to be allowed to review the information that you say prompted your letter and upon which your letter is putatively and entirely based,” Raskin wrote to Comer on Friday.
The witness who Republicans allege the CIA blocked from being interviewed is Kevin Morris, who serves as Hunter Biden’s lawyer and has previously testified that he cooperated with the criminal investigation by turning over documents and speaking with investigators.
CNN has also reached out to Morris for comment.
“I’ve made a document production in conjunction with the grand jury investigation,” Morris testified in his closed-door interview with Republicans conducting the inquiry in January.
“An FBI agent and an IRS agent showed up in my door with a subpoena in the Delaware prosecution, and we talked – we talked briefly. I don’t remember talking to the IRS guy,” he said at another point.
Republicans have raised questions about why Morris lent the president’s son millions of dollars and have sought to connect him to their impeachment inquiry into President Biden. Morris has explained the terms of the $6.5 million in loans and said they have nothing to do with the president.
Meanwhile, even one of the IRS whistleblowers who has claimed the criminal case into the president’s son deviated from normal practices also has testified that he met with Morris.
“Very briefly, at his residence, he offered to submit to an interview, but then said he wanted his lawyer very early on in that discussion,” Gary Shapley testified in December in a closed-door hearing with the House Ways & Means Committee about his meeting with Morris.

Opinion: If Marjorie Taylor Greene wins on Ukraine aid, we’re headed for dangerous territory
Editor’s Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. He is the author and editor of 25 books, including The New York Times bestseller “Myth America: Historians Take on the Biggest Legends and Lies About Our Past” (Basic Books). The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.
Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is the new boss in town. The representative, who is known for her reactionary rhetoric and references to conspiracy theories, is now strongly suggesting that she will force a vote to oust Republican Speaker Mike Johnson should he move forward with an aid package for Ukraine.
With a narrow Republican majority in the House and the ability of a single representative to call a vote to oust him, Johnson is stuck between a rock and a hard place. Greene is intent on blocking funding to Ukraine — a massive blow to both NATO and the US’ own commitment to the post-World War II international order.
One option, aimed at placating the far right flank of the party, would involve structuring funds to Ukraine as a loan rather than outright assistance. But that did little to satisfy Greene, who shot back with a blistering response, calling it  a “heaping, steaming pile of bullsh-t.”

Opinion: What the Wisconsin election results tell us about November
“This isn’t a Republican speaker we have right now; this is a Democrat speaker,” Greene said —  a highly misleading comment given that Johnson is arguably the most conservative speaker we’ve seen in modern times.
This standoff demonstrates just how far the Republican Party has moved from the era of Ronald Reagan. The party that once called on Soviet Premier Mikhail Gorbachev to “tear down this wall” is now fast becoming an America First party that effectively tells Russia’s Vladimir Putin, “Do whatever you want, just leave us alone.”
How did we get to this point?
Long before Greene, a growing number of Republicans began expressing increased skepticism toward international institutions like the United Nations.
While the internationalist wing of the party had triumphed over the neo-isolationists in the 1940s, by the mid-1960s, the Republican platform included a line that they would “never surrender to any international group the responsibility of the United States for its sovereignty.”
By the time Ronald Reagan was in the White House, a new generation in the GOP that was committed to unilateral military action started to gain strength. These Republicans did not want the United States to withdraw from the world but they were increasingly critical of institutions such as the United Nations and alliances like NATO.
In 1994, neoconservative and Republican foreign policy expert John Bolton famously said that if the UN building in New York “lost ten stories, it wouldn’t make a bit of difference.” Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from 1995 to 2001, once characterized foreign aid as “throwing money down foreign rat holes.”

This Republican skepticism became even more apparent when George W. Bush became president. He kicked off his term by withdrawing the US from the Kyoto Protocol, an international treaty aimed at curbing carbon emissions in 2001. Two years later, he launched a war against Iraq based on allegations of Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction program (which turned out to be wrong). Despite many key leaders, such as Frances’s Jacques Chirac, warning this was a huge mistake and a distraction from the war against al-Qaeda, Bush moved forward with the support of a paper thin “coalition of the willing.”
President Donald Trump picked up on this line of attack, using Bush’s failed war in Iraq as evidence that the United States should abandon many of the international alliances that had defined our policies since World War II.
The war, he said, was proof that foreign entanglements did not serve the national interest and should be avoided. America First, he touted instead, picking up on a mantra that had long been associated with isolationism, xenophobia and reactionary domestic politics. Not only did Trump elevate these arguments in the national conversation, but he pushed the entire party — particularly the House Caucus — toward new extremes. In doing so, he shattered his own party’s commitment to standing up against autocratic adversaries such as Putin.
It’s notable that in 2012, Republican nominee Mitt Romney blasted President Barack Obama for being weak on Russia. After Romney’s election loss, Trump’s 2016 campaign marked a major shift in the party’s foreign policy stance.
As president, Trump stood next to Putin in 2018, defending him at the Helsinki summit and questioning America’s own intelligence agencies. Earlier this year, when Trump said he would encourage Russia to attack NATO allies that did not pay their share as part of the alliance, Republican lawmakers barely batted an eye.
With Greene keeping Johnson’s feet to the fire when it comes to aid to Ukraine, the GOP’s revolution is almost complete. It’s clear that Trump has remade the party and the MAGA generation of Republicans is taking over.

Although Johnson might still pull out a narrow compromise that would allow a funding package to pass without losing his job, the GOP is moving in a clear direction on foreign policy. Unlike the Republican hawks of yore, the America First crowd is gaining traction and the implications are immense.
Far beyond the character of the Republican Party, this is a political battle that could result in the rapid erosion of international alliances we have depended on for decades to limit the odds of war and push back against despotic foreign leaders eager to expand their dangerous regimes.
If Greene and her colleagues win now, or even in the next faceoff over Ukraine, we will be entering a new, uncertain, and even more dangerous era.

Ukraine claims major drone strike on Russian airfield, killing servicemen and destroying aircraft
Ukraine launched a major drone attack on an airbase in Russia’s Rostov region, killing Russian servicemen and destroying fighter jets, according to a Ukrainian source with knowledge of the operation.
The Security Service of Ukraine and Ukrainian military were behind the strikes on the Morozovsk airfield in the Rostov region, which destroyed at least six Russian fighter jets, the source told CNN Friday, adding that “the operation is important to decrease Russian military potential.”
According to the source, the airfield was targeted because it was used as a base for aircraft “used to launch guided air bombs on Ukrainian positions and border settlements.” Approximately 20 Russian personnel were impacted – either killed or wounded, the source added.
CNN cannot independently verify the claims. If true, the strikes will be the most damaging carried out at an airfield inside Russia since the start of the conflict in February 2022.
Rostov Governor Vasily Golubev confirmed on Telegram an attack of over 40 drones in the Morozovsky district of the region, resulting in “minor damage” to an electrical substation damage but maintained that no-one was injured.

Several regions in Russia have been targeted by UAV attacks overnight, with the Ministry of Defense claiming Friday the interception and destruction of at least 53 Ukrainian drones across various territories.
According to the ministry, air defense systems intercepted 44 UAVs over the Rostov region, six UAVs over the Krasnodar region, and one each over the Saratov, Kursk and Belgorod regions.
In the city of Engels southeast of Saratov, where a strategic aviation base of the Russian Armed Forces is based, regional head Roman Busargin confirmed the interception of one drone but asserted no casualties or destruction.
Attacks on the Belgorod region near the Ukrainian border also continued with its governor, Vyacheslav Gladkov, reporting that the region came under fire from the Ukrainian Armed Forces which resulted in damage to electricity and gas supply lines.
The region of Rostov, which borders Ukraine in Russia’s south, has previously been impacted by Kyiv’s strategic aerial strikes.
In September 2023, a drone attack caused an explosion near Russia’s military headquarters in the city of Rostov-on-Don. Social media videos geolocated by CNN showed the attack in the vicinity of the military base.
Rostov-on-Don was briefly occupied by Wagner troops during the private military group’s brief rebellion against the Kremlin earlier this year.
Ukraine is showing increasing willingness to launch targeted strikes across the border, in an apparent attempt to slowly wear down domestic Russian support for the war and degrade Russian infrastructure.

Angelina Jolie alleges ‘history’ of Brad Pitt’s physical abuse prior to 2016 plane ride in new Miraval lawsuit filing
Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt’s fight over the French winery they once owned together is coming to a head and reigniting older conflicts, as new legal documents allege a “history of physical abuse of Jolie” on the part of Pitt prior to their fateful plane ride in 2016.
On Thursday, Jolie filed a motion with the Los Angeles Superior Court, a copy of which CNN has obtained, wherein she claims that she attempted to sell Pitt her stake in the Miraval winery and that their negotiations ultimately broke down after Pitt conditioned the sale on Jolie signing an NDA that “prohibited Jolie from speaking (other than in court) about Pitt’s abuse of Jolie and their children by attempting to tie Pitt’s personal reputation to Miraval’s business.”
This week’s new filing stems from Pitt’s 2022 lawsuit, in which he claimed that he and Jolie had an agreement that neither would sell their stake in the winery without the other’s consent. In a June 2023 filing, he alleged that Jolie’s sale of her stake in the winery was “vindictive” after an “adverse custody ruling.”
Jolie also claims in Thursday’s filing that Pitt’s “history of physical abuse of Jolie started well before the family’s September 2016 plane trip from France to Los Angeles,” but does not go into further detail about the alleged prior abuse.
“At trial, Jolie will prove through testimony, emails, photographs, and other evidence why Pitt was so concerned about his own misconduct that he blew up his own deal to purchase Jolie’s interest in Miraval because she refused to agree to his new, expansive NDA,” the filing reads.
Jolie claims in the filing on Thursday that she agreed to sign an NDA that was “limited to not disparaging Miraval’s wine business” as part of her initial deal to sell Pitt her stake in the winery, which they were close to finalizing at the time.
Pitt had previously claimed in his June 2023 amended complaint that after Jolie would not agree to sign his NDA, she proposed an even broader NDA that “would have provided that “[o]ther than in court pleadings or testimony, neither party shall directly or through a party’s representatives make in a public forum any derogatory remark about the other party.”
CNN has reached out to a representative for Pitt seeking comment on the new allegations outlined in Thursday’s filing.
“Mr. Pitt refused to purchase Ms. Jolie’s interest when she would not be silenced by his NDA. By refusing to buy her interest but then suing her, Mr. Pitt put directly at issue why that NDA was so important to him and what he hoped it would bury: his abuse of Ms. Jolie and their family,” Paul Murphy, Jolie’s attorney, told CNN in a statement on Thursday. “After eight months of delays, this motion asks the Court to force Mr. Pitt to finally produce that evidence.”
Jolie never ended up pressing charges against Pitt in relation to the 2016 altercation, according to the filing, because she believed “the best course was for Pitt to accept responsibility and help the family recover from the post-traumatic stress he caused.”
CNN previously reported that Pitt was not arrested or charged in connection with the 2016 incident after the FBI completed its investigation, and a representative for Pitt disputed Jolie’s account of that incident included in an October 2022 filing. Pitt’s representative said in a statement to CNN at the time that “Brad has accepted responsibility for what he did but will not for things he didn’t do.”
In October 2021, Jolie sold her half of the winery to Tenute del Mondo, a subsidiary of Stoli Group, controlled by Russian oligarch Yuri Shefler.
The ongoing legal proceedings and “Pitt’s unyielding attempts to control and punish Jolie continue to take a huge emotional and financial toll on her and their family,” the filing reads. “Jolie longs for their family to be able to heal and their children to be spared further pain and trauma, and truly wishes Pitt would want the same too.”
Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in 2016. They were declared legally single in 2019, and a joint custody arrangement was established in 2021.
Legal proceedings as they pertain to the Miraval dispute also remain ongoing. The former couple purchased the country estate and winery in the south of France in 2008.

RFK Jr. raises possibility that January 6 wasn’t a ‘true insurrection’
Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Friday raised the possibility that the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol was not a “true insurrection” and expressed concern about the “weaponization of government” against those charged with crimes in connection to the riot.
“It is quite clear that many of the January 6 protestors broke the law in what may have started as a protest but turned into a riot. Because it happened with the encouragement of President Trump, and in the context of his delusion that the election was stolen from him, many people see it not as a riot but as an insurrection,” he said in a statement.
He continued, “I have not examined the evidence in detail, but reasonable people, including Trump opponents, tell me there is little evidence of a true insurrection.”
The statement inaccurately says that none of the protesters had plans to overthrow the government, even though some of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers were convicted of sedition. It also repeated the long-debunked claim that the rioters “carried no weapons” while attacking the Capitol, which Kennedy later said he was retracting when reached by CNN for comment.

Fact check: RFK Jr. repeats, and then retracts, long-debunked claim that January 6 rioters ‘carried no weapons’
“My understanding that none of the January 6 rioters who invaded the capitol were carrying firearms was incorrect,” he said in response to CNN’s inquiry.
In the statement, Kennedy called the January 6 attack “one of the most polarizing topics on the political landscape” and said he wants “to hear every side” of the issue in the lengthy statement. He condemned protesters who broke the law and Trump’s “delusion that the election was stolen” while questioning whether “political objectives” led to the prosecution of January 6 protestors.
“Like many reasonable Americans, I am concerned about the possibility that political objectives motivated the vigor of the prosecution of the J6 defendants, their long sentences, and their harsh treatment,” Kennedy said in the statement. “That would fit a disturbing pattern of the weaponization of government agencies — the DoJ, the IRS, the SEC, the FBI, etc. — against political opponents.”
“One can, as I do, oppose Donald Trump and all he stands for, and still be disturbed by the weaponization of government against him,” he continued.
His rhetoric, whitewashing the January 6 attack, mirrors some of the commentary coming from Trump and other right-wing figures.
Undercutting Kennedy’s claims that the cases have been politically motivated, the rigorous prosecutions of January 6 rioters began almost immediately, while Trump was still president, and while his appointees were running the Justice Department.
Further, prosecutors have used discretion while deciding who to charge. They have largely focused on people who entered the Capitol itself. Thousands of Trump supporters who were captured on video blatantly breaching Capitol grounds, but not stepping foot in the building, are not currently facing any charges.
A bipartisan majority of Congress voted that January 6 was an “insurrection” during Trump’s second impeachment, though Trump was acquitted at his Senate trial in 2021.
In the statement, Kennedy pledged to name an independent special counsel to investigate “whether prosecutorial discretion was abused for political ends” in January 6 cases.
“As President, I will appoint a special counsel — an individual respected by all sides — to investigate whether prosecutorial discretion was abused for political ends in this case, and I will right any wrongs that we discover. Without the impartial rule of law, there is no true democracy or moral governance,” Kennedy said.
Kennedy sought to criticize both Trump and President Joe Biden’s response to the January 6 insurrection, which he said stokes partisan divides in the country, in an effort to distinguish himself as an alternative to both candidates.
“Both establishment parties are using J6 to pour fuel on the fire of America’s divisions. Each side claims that a victory by their opponents means the end of democracy. Then, anything is justified to stop them. We run the risk of destroying democracy in order to save it,” Kennedy said. “Instead of demonizing our opponents as apocalyptic threats to democracy, let’s focus on the issues and priorities of how they will govern, and defeat them at the ballot box rather than through legal maneuvers and dirty tricks.”
The Democratic National Committee condemned Kennedy’s statement for “downplaying the seriousness of January 6th.”
“After hours of negative press coverage, RFK Jr. used hundreds of words to both-sides the January 6th insurrection. There aren’t two sides to violent rioters who assaulted police officers and tried to overthrow our democracy,” DNC spokesperson Matt Corridoni said.
Kennedy’s statement comes after his campaign sent fundraising emails earlier this week that referred to January 6 defendants as “activists” who have been “stripped of their constitutional liberties.”
On Thursday, Kennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear told CNN the language in the fundraising email “does not reflect Mr. Kennedy’s views” and said Kennedy believes those who “violated the law” in connection to January 6 “should be subject to appropriate criminal and/or civil penalties.”
Kennedy has recently downplayed the risks to democracy that either candidate poses, telling CNN’s Erin Burnett on Monday he believes neither candidate poses a genuine threat to democracy, but labeling Biden as the candidate who poses the greater threat. Kennedy’s argument was based in being banned on some social media platforms during the Biden administration.
“(Trump) overthrowing — trying to overthrow the election clearly is threat to democracy,” Kennedy said in a CNN interview on Monday. “But the question was, who is a worse threat to democracy? And what I would say is … I’m not going to answer that question. But I can argue that President Biden is because the First Amendment, Erin, is the most important.”

Diplomatic spat grows between Ecuador and Mexico
A rift between Mexico and Ecuador is growing, with a series of diplomatic provocations this week that culminated in Ecuador rejecting Mexico’s ambassador to the country, and Mexico announcing that it would offer asylum to a wanted Ecuadorean politician.
Mexican Ambassador Raquel Serur Smeke was declared “persona non grata” in Ecuador on Thursday after Mexico’s President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador appeared to criticize Ecuador’s recent elections.
Ecuador’s 2023 run-off vote took place in a “very strange” manner, Lopez Obrador said, suggesting that presidential candidates used the media, candidate Fernando Villavicencio’s assassination, and overall violence in their favor while campaigning.
In a statement posted on X, Ecuador’s Foreign Ministry called Lopez Obrador’s comments “unfortunate” and said the country is still mourning Villavicencio’s assassination. It also reiterated its focus on ensuring “respect for the dignity and sovereignty of the Ecuadorian State” and “non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States.”
Diplomatic relations are expected to remain open between the two countries. However, a press release by the Mexican Foreign Ministry on Friday lamented the Ecuadorean decision as “disproportionate” and announced that Mexico had decided to grant political asylum to Ecuador’s former Vice President Jorge David Glas Espinel – a move that Ecuador’s Foreign Minister Gabriela Sommerfield quickly slammed as “interference in internal affairs.”
Glas served under leftist ex-President Rafael Correa between 2013 and 2017. Convicted twice on corruption charges, Glas says that he is the subject of political persecution, and has been sheltering inside the Mexican Embassy in Quito, according to Reuters.

Elon Musk’s reversal on blue checkmarks shows his desperation to lure high-profile users back to X
Editor’s Note: A version of this article first appeared in the “Reliable Sources” newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.
Elon Musk has given up, restoring the “lords and peasants” blue checkmark system he once admonished and assailed as elitism.
After insisting that journalists, celebrities and other notable users pay him $8 a month for Twitter’s once-coveted blue checkmark, the erratic billionaire has thrown in the towel, widely restoring blue badges to prominent accounts on the imperiled social media platform.
A number of people — including yours truly — woke up on Thursday to learn that X had declared them “an influential member of the community” and, thus, would be giving them “a complimentary subscription to X Premium.” The message the company sent to those users noted that X “reserves the right to cancel the complimentary subscription in its sole discretion.” (Translation: If you’re mean to Musk, you are likely putting yourself in jeopardy of losing it.)
The move is a major reversal by Musk, who made user payments for the blue checkmark a central tenet of his plan to build a subscription business on X and reduce the platform’s heavy dependency on advertiser dollars. “Trash me all day, but it’ll cost $8,” Musk insisted, endlessly repeating a version of that message to the vocal and constant complaints of users.
“To all complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8,” Musk declared.
Musk — who often uses his perch as the most-followed user on X to share absurd and dangerous right-wing conspiracy theories — also took glee in stripping journalists of their status. The thin-skinned Musk has repeatedly smeared the press and, when he took over the platform, made it a point to strip journalists of any special cachet they carried, framing it as a move aimed at empowering the masses.

Elon Musk’s X is back to giving out free blue checks. It’s no surprise they were a tough sell
“Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark is bullshit,” Musk wrote in November 2022. “Power to the people!”
Naturally, users pushed back against his plans, noting that verification of journalists offered the public a helpful way of quickly identifying credible sources of news. In reality, the legacy verification system benefited the average user far more than it benefited those who were given the badges. But Musk, blind or disinterested in that reality, vigorously pushed back.
“You represent the problem: journalists who think they are the only source of legitimate information,” Musk wrote to one protesting user. “That’s the big lie.”
“Empowering the public relative to journalists sure is a great way to earn negative press 🤣🤣,” Musk said in another post.
But most journalists and other notable users who once sported the checkmark declined to fork over the cash. Instead, the people willing to shell out money for the status symbol consisted of a cocktail of Musk super-fans, right-wing trolls and others who would not have been able to attain a checkmark under the legacy system which required them to be a notable public figure. (Ironically, a fair continent of this group spent years mocking journalists for supposedly being obsessed with the checkmark, only to pay $8 for it while the journalists declined).
Even worse, trolls impersonating the identities of others were granted blue checkmarks, stripping the symbol of its core value: identity verification.
As a direct result, the once-coveted status symbol lost all its value, instead becoming a toxic sign of obedience and fealty to Musk, which many users rejected. This week, when Musk suddenly appended checkmarks to the accounts of “influential members of the community,” plenty of users loudly noted that they had not paid for it.
“What happened? I didn’t pay for this. I would NEVER pay for this,” actress Yvette Nicole Brown posted on X.
“Stating for the record I did NOT pay to have my check mark restored,” added the conservative commentator Amanda Carpenter.

Elon Musk’s X names new head of safety, nine months after former safety leader’s exit
A representative for X did not respond to a request for comment on Musk’s move to restore the blue checkmarks. But it’s obvious.
Since Musk’s disastrous takeover of the social media company, the platform has been on a downward spiral. Notably, X’s daily usage has plummeted over the last year, with the user base down a staggering 23%, according to data Sensor Tower provided NBC News’ David Ingram. Daily active users are down an additional 18%, the analytics firm added.
That’s an alarming trend for the platform, which likes to market itself as the place where live conversation occurs. Meanwhile, Meta’s X competitor, Threads, continues to show growth, with Mark Zuckerberg telling investors in February that the platform has grown to more than 130 million monthly active users. Zuckerberg has said that his goal is to get Threads to 1 billion users. And other platforms like Mastodon and BlueSky have also become refuges for Twitter exiles.
It all spells trouble for Musk, whose platform continues to descend into an uninhabitable right-wing fever swamp (quite frankly, it already can be fairly defined as such). Don’t just take my word for it, either. The evidence is plain as day in Musk’s own public actions. The billionaire has grown so desperate to lure back one-time power users, he is reversing course on what was his rallying cry against the elites.
Gone are the days when Musk poked the journalists and celebrity class about paying him $8 a month. Now, Musk is so desperate to see their return, he’s willing to crown them with the blue badge and restore their accounts to “lord” status. That says it all.

Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs’ son Christian Combs accused of sexual assault in lawsuit
Christian Combs, son of rapper, producer and businessman Sean “Diddy” Combs, is accused of sexual assault in a new lawsuit that names both men.
The 31-page lawsuit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Thursday, according to an attorney for the plaintiff, Grace O’Marcaigh.
O’Marcaigh worked as a crew member and bartender on a yacht leased by Sean Combs and his family in December 2022, according to the lawsuit.

A closer look at the sexual misconduct lawsuits against Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs
The experience was “sold as a wholesome family excursion” but turned into a “hedonistic environment,” the lawsuit says, and suspected sex workers and other celebrities were often brought aboard.
In the early morning of December 28, Christian Combs pressured O’Marcaigh to drink a shot of tequila and shortly thereafter he assaulted her, the lawsuit says. O’Marcaigh believes the tequila, which she says Christian Combs brought aboard, may have been laced with drugs, according to the lawsuit.
Sean Combs is not accused of sexual assault in the lawsuit but is included on allegations of liability and aiding and abetting.
Aaron Dyer, an attorney for Sean and Christian Combs, said in a statement to CNN that they believe the lawsuit contains “manufactured lies and irrelevant facts,” and says he will seeking to “dismiss this outrageous claim.”
This lawsuit is the latest in a series filed against Sean Combs and follows searches by federal investigators at his homes in Los Angeles and the Miami area last week. The previous lawsuits accuse him of a range of sexual misconduct and other illegal activities. The recording industry mogul had denied all of the allegations.
Lawsuit cites audio recording
The lawsuit cites an audio recording from a makeshift recording studio on the yacht, which O’Marcaigh said is where the alleged assault began. According to a partial transcript included in the lawsuit, O’Marcaigh was being pressured to take a shot and asked Christian Combs, “Are you drugging me?” with Combs answering, “Take the shot.”
CNN has listened to the audio recordings and can independently verify the transcript detailed in the lawsuit.
In addition to the tense conversation purportedly between Combs and O’Marcaigh, Cassie’s 2006 pop hit “Me & U,” which features Sean “Diddy” Combs, can be heard playing in the background. Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, is Diddy’s former girlfriend who alleges she was raped and subjected to years of repeated physical and other abuses by the music mogul. In November 2023, Ventura and Diddy reached a settlement one day after the singer filed her complaint, which was the first lawsuit in a series of sexual abuse allegations against Diddy, though an attorney for the rapper denied Ventura’s allegations and said the settlement was “in no way an admission of wrongdoing.”

On the yacht, Christian Combs “cornered” O’Marcaigh in a room and “became physical and extremely aggressive,” the lawsuit states.
Combs grabbed O’Marcaigh by the arm and attempted force himself on her, the filing continues, and stopped only when another yacht employee entered the room.
Photos included in the court filing appear to show bruises on the plaintiff’s forearm.
Following the alleged assault, O’Marcaigh’s mental and physical health deteriorated, according to the lawsuit. She began suffering from anxiety and panic attacks, among other issues, the lawsuit says.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages.

Walmart shoppers could claim up to $500 as part of a class-action settlement
Walmart shoppers could be entitled to as much as $500 as part of a class-action lawsuit settlement by the retailer over allegations that it overcharged customers for certain products.
A lawsuit initially filed in late 2022, and subsequently amended in 2023, alleged that Walmart “falsely inflated” the prices of certain sold-by-weight products, including those that feature the retailer’s “rollbacks,” or discounts.
It alleged that shoppers at checkout were deceptively led to think they were paying the lowered prices on those goods such as meats, poultry and seafood.
The suit alleged Walmart also mislabeled the weight of bagged produce such as oranges, grapefruit and tangerines by falsely advertising the weight as more than the actual weight of those grocery items.
Walmart reached a settlement late last year to pay $45 million to customers, while denying any allegations of wrongdoing.
Walmart, in a statement to CNN on Friday, said it “will continue providing our customers everyday low prices to help them save money on the products they want and need. We still deny the allegations, however we believe a settlement is in the best interest of both parties.”
According to the terms of the settlement, any Walmart customer who bought weighted goods and/or bagged citrus at a Walmart store, supercenter or neighborhood market store in the United States or Puerto Rico from Oct, 19, 2018, through January 19, 2024, could be eligible for a cash payment.
The cash payments will vary, depending on what was bought during the period.
They include:
–$10 without a receipt, but a shopper can attest to buying up to 50 weighted goods and/or bagged citrus in-person in a Walmart store during the settlement class period.
–$15 without a receipt or other proof of purchase, but they can attest to buying from 51 up to 75 weighted goods and/or bagged citrus.
–$20 without receipts or proof of purchase, but they can attest to buying from 76 up to 100 weighted goods and/or bagged citrus.
–$25 without receipts or proof of purchase but attest to buying 101 or more weighted goods and/or bagged citrus.
–Up to $500 with receipts or other proof of purchase of each weighted goods and/or bagged citrus purchased in a Walmart store during the settlement class period, customers will receive 2% of “the total cost of the substantiated Weighted Goods and Bagged Citrus Purchased,” up to $500.
Customers can also try to retrieve receipts from Walmart’s website.
Walmart shoppers can file a claim online or via mail, postmarked, on or before June 5, 2024.

Reigning Tour de France champion Jonas Vingegaard in hospital following horror crash
Defending Tour de France champion Jonas Vingegaard is in hospital after suffering a horror crash during stage four of the Tour of the Basque Country on Thursday.
His cycling team, Team Visma, said that Vingegaard suffered a broken collarbone, several broken ribs, a pulmonary contusion and pneumothorax, or collapsed lung.

“He is stable and had a good night,” the team added. “He remains in hospital.”
Vingegaard’s injury puts his Tour de France title defense in jeopardy, with the race starting earlier this year on June 29 due to the Paris Olympics.
The crash took place around 40 kilometers from the end of the stage as the riders came around a right turn on a descent, with fellow Grand Tour winners Primož Roglič and Remco Evenepoel also involved.
Television footage showed Vingegaard being taken away on a stretcher and put into an ambulance.
Evenepoel, the 2022 Vuelta a España winner, also suffered a fractured collarbone, his Quick-Step Pro Cycling Team said in a statement, as well as a fractured right shoulder blade.
“Obviously my plans for the short [near] future will change, but I hope and think my longterm goals will not change,” Evenepoel said in a video released by his team on X.
“Everything should be okay with that. Then I need to thank all of the doctors, and also the doctor of the team, that took care of me in the last couple of hours and, of course, I want to wish all of the riders that were involved in the crash all the best, a speedy recovery and I hope to see you all soon on the road again.”
Quick-Step said Evenepoel will travel to Belgium on Friday for surgery on his collarbone.
Other injuries sustained in the crash include a cervical and two thoracic spine vertebral body fractures for Team Emirates rider Jay Vine and a concussion and fractured sternum for EF Pro Cycling’s Sean Quinn.

The space shuttle was revolutionary for its time. What went wrong?
The CNN Original Series “Space Shuttle Columbia: The Final Flight” uncovers the events that ultimately led to disaster. The four-part documentary premieres at 9 p.m. ET/PT Sunday.
Upon its inception, NASA’s space shuttle program promised to usher in a new era of exploration, keeping astronauts space-bound with a reusable and relatively cheap ride into orbit. It was a project that forever altered the course of spaceflight with its triumphs — and its tragic failures.
Deemed an “engineering marvel,” the first of five winged orbiters — the space shuttle Columbia — made its inaugural flight in 1981.
Twenty-two years and 28 trips to space later, the same shuttle broke apart during its final return to Earth, killing all seven crew members on board.
The tragedy spelled the end for the US space agency’s transformative shuttle program. And its memory continues to reverberate in the halls of NASA today, leaving a lasting mark on its consideration of safety.
“Human history teaches us that in exploration, after accidents like this occur, we can learn from them and further reduce risk, although we must honestly admit that risks can never be eliminated,” said then-NASA Administrator Sean O’Keefe, who ran the agency from 2001 to 2004, in a speech before members of Congress shortly after the Columbia disaster.
After the shuttle program was retired, no US astronaut would travel to space on an American-made rocket for nearly a decade.
Reimagining rocketry
The space shuttle project was forged in the optimism of NASA’s Apollo program, which landed 12 astronauts on the surface of the moon and bested America’s Soviet rivals during the Cold War.
Apollo was, however, extraordinarily expensive: NASA spent $25.8 billion (or more than $200 billion when adjusted for inflation) — according to a cost analysis from space policy expert Casey Dreier of the nonprofit Planetary Society.
With financial constraints on the horizon, by the mid-1970s, engineers within NASA were building an entirely new means of space transportation.
Apollo used towering rockets and small capsules — destined to be flown just once — that would plunge back home from space and parachute to an ocean landing.
The space shuttle concept was a remarkable pivot: Reusable, winged orbiters would take off strapped to rockets, sail through Earth’s orbit and glide to an airplane-esque runway landing. From there, the shuttle could be refurbished and flown again, theoretically driving down the cost of each mission.
Shuttle’s legacy
Over the course of three decades, NASA’s fleet of space shuttles flew 135 missions — launching and repairing satellites, building a permanent home for astronauts with the International Space Station and commissioning the revolutionary Hubble Space Telescope.
But the shuttle program, which ended in 2011, never lived up to the US space agency’s initial vision.
Each shuttle launch cost about $1.5 billion on average, according to a 2018 paper from a researcher at NASA’s Ames Research Center. That’s hundreds of millions of dollars more than what the space agency had hoped for at the program’s outset, even when adjusted for inflation. Long delays and technical setbacks also beleaguered its missions.
“Every single mission that I was there for was scrubbed, rescheduled, delayed because something wasn’t exactly right,” said O’Keefe, the former NASA administrator, in a new CNN documentary series, “Space Shuttle Columbia: The Final Flight.”
And two disasters — the Challenger explosion in 1986 and the loss of Columbia in 2003 — cost the lives of 14 astronauts.
The Columbia disaster: Looking back
On the morning of February 1, 2003, the Columbia orbiter was heading home from a 16-day mission to space.
The seven-person crew on board had carried out dozens of science experiments while in orbit, and the astronauts were slated to land at 9:16 a.m. ET in Florida.
In pictures: Space Shuttle Columbia's final flight
NASA engineers knew that a piece of foam — used to insulate the shuttle’s large, orange fuel tank — had broken off during the January 16 launch, striking the Columbia orbiter.
The space agency’s stance, however, was that the lightweight insulation material likely didn’t cause significant harm. Some foam had broken off on earlier missions and caused slight damage, but it was deemed an “accepted flight risk,” according to the official Columbia accident investigation report.
It was later revealed, however, that concerns about the foam’s impact were swept under the rug by NASA management, according to previous reporting and “Space Shuttle Columbia: The Final Flight.”
“I was very upset and angry and disappointed with my engineering organizations, top to bottom,” said Rodney Rocha, a chief NASA shuttle engineer, in the new series.
The astronauts even received an email from mission control alerting them about the foam strike on the eighth day of their mission, reassuring them there was no reason for alarm, according to NASA.
But the assumption was wrong.
An investigation later revealed the dislodged foam had struck Columbia’s left wing during launch, damaging the spacecraft’s thermal protection system.
The issue didn’t affect crew members while they spent more than two weeks in space.
But heat protection is crucial for the dangerous return home. As with every mission that returns from orbit, the vehicle had to dive back into the thick of the Earth’s atmosphere while still traveling at more than 17,000 miles per hour (27,359 kilometers per hour). The pressure and friction on a spacecraft can heat up the exterior to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (1,649 degrees Celsius).
Reentry proved too much for the damaged Columbia shuttle. As the vehicle approached its destination, crossing over New Mexico into Texas, the orbiter began to disintegrate — visibly shedding chunks of debris.
At 8:59 a.m. ET, ground controllers lost contact with the crew.
The final dispatch came from mission commander Rick Husband, who said, “Roger, uh,” before he was cut off.
At 9 a.m., onlookers saw Columbia explode over East Texas and watched in horror as it showered the area with debris.
The realities of risk
Two decades later, the Columbia tragedy and the broader shuttle program offer crucial perspective about the perils and triumphs of spaceflight.
NASA entered the era confidently, anticipating that the odds of a shuttle being destroyed during flight were around 1 in 100,000.
The space agency reevaluated that risk, estimating after the Challenger disaster that the shuttle had carried a 1 in 100 chance of disaster.
“If somebody told me, ‘Hey, you can go on this roller coaster ride, and there’s a 1 in 100 chance that you’ll die. Well, there’s no chance in the world — no chance in hell — I would do that,” US Sen. Mark Kelly, a former NASA space shuttle astronaut, told “The Final Flight” documentarians.
“But I also think that people generally think it’s not going to be them,” Kelly added.

King Charles is opening up Balmoral Castle for the first time
Editor’s Note: This is a version of CNN’s Royal News, a weekly dispatch bringing you the inside track on Britain’s royal family. Sign up here.
King Charles III is opening the doors of Balmoral Castle this summer for the most intimate tours ever permitted around the British royal family’s much-loved private Scottish home.
The tours will run daily from July 4 to August 11 but a booking frenzy saw all the tickets - priced at £100 ($126) - snapped up by royal fans within 24 hours.
Situated on the bank of the Dee river in Scotland’s Cairngorms National Park, the Balmoral estate has been the Scottish residence of the clan since 1852, when it was bought by Prince Albert for his wife, Queen Victoria.
Things got off to a rocky start for the couple. The original property was deemed too small for the royal family so another, more substantial, castle had to be built just 100 yards away. Since then, the 50,000-acre estate has provided comfort and privacy for the Windsors, particularly during times of crisis.
This summer, for the first time since the castle was completed in 1856, visitors will be given unprecedented access to parts of the royal retreat that have never been open to the public before.
The move to open up the grounds appears to be part of a broader drive by the King to make royal residences more accessible. The East Wing of Buckingham Palace, which includes the famous central balcony where members of the royal family gather for public appearances, will also be open to the public this summer for the first time. Meanwhile, the grounds of other royal properties like Windsor, Sandringham, Holyroodhouse and Highgrove have routinely opened up for various events.
Back at Balmoral, perhaps one of the tour’s most impressive pit stops will be the castle’s ballroom, which was where the late Queen Elizabeth II lay in rest before making the six-hour journey to Edinburgh in September 2022.
An exhibition held in the ballroom will display a collection of the watercolor artworks by the King’s own hand, depicting scenery at Balmoral and two other royal estates, Highgrove and Sandringham, as well as outfits worn by Charles, his late mother, his grandmother and his wife, Queen Camilla.
During the hour-long tour, which is restricted to 10 people, visitors will be taken on a “historical journey” from the purchase of the estate in the 1850s to the present day, according to the estate’s website. “You will see why Balmoral is such a special place,” the website says.

There’s also the opportunity to celebrate the occasion with a serving of traditional afternoon tea at the onsite restaurant, for an extra £50 - around $63.
As well as the grouse shoots, picnics and muddy dog walks that keep members of the family entertained during the long summer days, the estate has also been a place of solace where the royals can enjoy time out of the limelight.
It is where Prince William and Prince Harry were told the tragic news that their mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, had died. More recently, it is where Queen Elizabeth II spent her final days as England’s longest reigning monarch.
“I think granny is most happy there,” Princess Eugenie told ITV in 2016. “It’s a lovely base for granny and grandpa to be for us to come and see them.”
But despite the privacy that Balmoral affords the family, it isn’t the first time that the estate has been open to the public. Previous tours have allowed visitors to explore parts of the estate’s grounds and gardens, but access has always been limited to just one room inside the castle itself.
It is also a little known fact that you can book out five cottages found within the estate’s walls. Some lucky guests have even bumped into the landlord during their stay.
“That’s exactly what happened to me this summer while taking an evening walk around the castle,” former CNNer Jill O’Brien wrote in 2013. “Several loud barking corgis ran up to say hello. It took a minute to realize that the elderly woman walking the dogs was Queen Elizabeth II.”
Charles and Camilla tend to travel to Balmoral in August for a late-summer break. The trip this year will no doubt provide some welcome respite for the couple following the King’s cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment.
At the end of the tour, visitors can mark the occasion by purchasing some homemade preserves or Balmoral whisky from the Mews Gift Shop - or perhaps some tweed, which might last a lot longer.

Plans for $1.3 billion waterfront development in Oman unveiled
Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.
Oman’s capital of Muscat is set to get an expansive $1.3 billion waterfront development, designed by globally renowned Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA).
The 3.3 million square-meter Al Khuwair Muscat Downtown and Waterfront development will include a residential complex, a marina, a cultural district, numerous canal walkways and a ministerial campus. Work is set to start at the end of this year and the area is expected to house more than 60,000 people when completed.
ZHA’s associate director, architect Paolo Zilli, told CNN he spent around a year finalizing the model he presented to Oman’s Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning.
Central to ZIlli’s design was facilitating access to public transport. “The vision is actually to remove all the cars, to remove all the fences and to create a campus of the ministry with many functions that can attract families and a new generation,” he said.
ZHA says it will encourage pedestrians by providing shading and passive cooling, and incorporate infrastructure to improve cycling safety. The use of onsite solar power will be “maximized” and native plant species will be conserved and restored.
Oman’s economy has long depended on oil, but it is now investing heavily in real-estate projects to drive more foreign investment, and ultimately boost non-oil revenues, part of the country’s National Vision 2040 strategy. In Muscat, the population is projected to increase from 1.5 million to 2.7 million by that year.
“There are a lot of changes,” Dr. Khalfan bin Saeed bin Mubarak al-Shueili, Oman’s Minister of Housing and Urban Planning, told CNN. “We [are] going to change the economy based on talent and capability skills and maybe also the digital sector.
“In Muscat itself, we anticipate the requirement of another 300,000 homes. And if we are doing good, then … this probably could expand to 600,000 homes.”
UK-based Zaha Hadid Architects is named after its storied founder, who in 2004 became the first woman to win architecture’s highest honor, the Pritzker Prize. She died in 2016, having designed high-profile buildings from Guangzhou Opera House, in China, to the Phaeno science centre in Wolfsburg, Germany. Since then, ZHA’s designs include the BEEAH Headquarters in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, which is partly powered by Tesla battery packs, and in 2022 it unveiled plans for a virtual city in the metaverse, intended to be a cyber libertarian utopia.

Elon Musk announces Tesla will unveil a ‘robotaxi’ on August 8
Elon Musk has long had an affinity for self-driving vehicles, claiming they will be one of Tesla’s most important products. Despite big promise﻿s, years have gone by without cars that can, so far, drive on their own.
But Musk, on a Friday afternoon, when companies tend to bury news, announced on X that Tesla would unveil its robotaxi on August 8.
His post was simple and included no details. “Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8,” the Tesla CEO (and owner of X) posted.
Musk has said in the past that Tesla will make a car without controls for a human to use. He has also said in the past that Tesla cars equipped with Full Self-Driving Capability will, through software updates, gradually become better and better at driving. At some point, the cars will be capable of operating as fully autonomous taxis and could earn money for their owners by giving taxi rides on their own, Musk has repeatedly said.
So far, the company has passed several of Musk’s predictions for when actual self-driving would be possible.
Tesla five years ago, in April 2019, said it expected to begin operating robotaxis by 2020. The company predicted the autonomous cars would last 11 years and drive 1 million miles, making the company and the car’s operators $30,000 in profit each year.
But Musk also acknowledged that his track record for predictions can be off – sometimes by a mile.
“The only criticism and it’s a fair one, sometimes I’m not on time. But I get it done and the Tesla team gets it done,” Musk said at the April 2019 event.
Currently, Full Self-Driving capability can be purchased with a new Tesla Model 3, for instance, for an additional $12,000 added to the car’s roughly $40,000 purchase price. It can be also be purchased on a subscription basis for up to $199 a month, depending on how the car was originally equipped.
In small gray type, Tesla’s on-line description points out, “The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous,” meaning that it is not, in fact, capable of fully self-driving today.
Musk has said the system will one day make Tesla cars incredibly valuable.
“You can think of every car we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as something that in the future may be worth five times what it is today,” he said in the company’s earnings call for the third quarter last year.
Experts who have tested the system say that, as of now, it is still far from being able to drive on its own without human intervention.
Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology for Consumer Reports, recently tested the system and said she’s less worried about its safety than she is about ordinary Tesla Autopilot, which is designed to provide more limited driving assistance mainly on highways. Ironically, that’s because the Full Self-Driving technology performs so poorly. Funkhouser described it as like giving control of your car to a novice teen driver.
“You’re not likely to tune out and become complacent or over-reliant on it,” she said. “In fact, I would say you’re potentially more alert.”
A number of companies, including Waymo, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, as well as GM subsidiary Cruise, are working on autonomous ride-sharing services.
Cruise has paused its testing work after one of its self-driving cars hit and dragged a pedestrian. An internal review found that company representatives had failed to be fully open with regulators about the incident. The company is being investigated by the Department of Justice over the incident.
Waymo recently had to recall its own cars after two of its cars hit the same tow truck  within minutes of one another.

Elon Musk announces Tesla will unveil a ‘robotaxi’ on August 8
Elon Musk has long had an affinity for self-driving vehicles, claiming they will be one of Tesla’s most important products. Despite big promise﻿s, years have gone by without cars that can, so far, drive on their own.
But Musk, on a Friday afternoon, when companies tend to bury news, announced on X that Tesla would unveil its robotaxi on August 8.
His post was simple and included no details. “Tesla Robotaxi unveil on 8/8,” the Tesla CEO (and owner of X) posted.
Musk has said in the past that Tesla will make a car without controls for a human to use. He has also said in the past that Tesla cars equipped with Full Self-Driving Capability will, through software updates, gradually become better and better at driving. At some point, the cars will be capable of operating as fully autonomous taxis and could earn money for their owners by giving taxi rides on their own, Musk has repeatedly said.
So far, the company has passed several of Musk’s predictions for when actual self-driving would be possible.
Tesla five years ago, in April 2019, said it expected to begin operating robotaxis by 2020. The company predicted the autonomous cars would last 11 years and drive 1 million miles, making the company and the car’s operators $30,000 in profit each year.
But Musk also acknowledged that his track record for predictions can be off – sometimes by a mile.
“The only criticism and it’s a fair one, sometimes I’m not on time. But I get it done and the Tesla team gets it done,” Musk said at the April 2019 event.
Currently, Full Self-Driving capability can be purchased with a new Tesla Model 3, for instance, for an additional $12,000 added to the car’s roughly $40,000 purchase price. It can be also be purchased on a subscription basis for up to $199 a month, depending on how the car was originally equipped.
In small gray type, Tesla’s on-line description points out, “The currently enabled features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous,” meaning that it is not, in fact, capable of fully self-driving today.
Musk has said the system will one day make Tesla cars incredibly valuable.
“You can think of every car we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as something that in the future may be worth five times what it is today,” he said in the company’s earnings call for the third quarter last year.
Experts who have tested the system say that, as of now, it is still far from being able to drive on its own without human intervention.
Kelly Funkhouser, associate director of vehicle technology for Consumer Reports, recently tested the system and said she’s less worried about its safety than she is about ordinary Tesla Autopilot, which is designed to provide more limited driving assistance mainly on highways. Ironically, that’s because the Full Self-Driving technology performs so poorly. Funkhouser described it as like giving control of your car to a novice teen driver.

Terraform Labs and founder Do Kwon found liable in US civil fraud trial
A jury in Manhattan found Singapore-based Terraform Labs and its founder Do Kwon liable on civil fraud charges on Friday, agreeing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that they misled investors before their stablecoin’s 2022 collapse shocked cryptocurrency markets.
The jury delivered the verdict in federal court in the two-week trial after hearing closing arguments earlier in the day.
The SEC accused the company and Kwon of misleading investors in 2021 about the stability of TerraUSD, a stablecoin designed to maintain a value of $1. The regulator also accused them of falsely claiming Terraform’s blockchain was used in a popular Korean mobile payment app.
Kwon designed TerraUSD and Luna, a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD. The SEC has estimated that investors lost more than $40 billion on the two tokens combined when the TerraUSD peg to the dollar could not be maintained in May 2022.
The SEC is seeking civil financial penalties and orders barring Kwon and Terraform from the securities industry. US District Judge Jed Rakoff will consider penalties in the coming weeks after hearing from the SEC and the defendants.
A spokesperson for Terraform said the company is disappointed by the verdict and weighing its options.
“We continue to maintain that the SEC does not have the legal authority to bring this case at all,” the spokesperson added.
SEC Division of Enforcement Director Gurbir Grewal said the agency is pleased with the verdict.
“For all of crypto’s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people,” Grewal said, adding, “it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance.”
A lawyer for Kwon declined to comment.
The collapse of TerraUSD and Luna dragged down the value of other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, and caused wider havoc in the crypto market, leading several companies to file for bankruptcy in 2022.
Terraform filed for bankruptcy protection in January.
Kwon, who was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023, did not attend the trial, which began on March 25. Both the United States and South Korea, where Kwon is a citizen, have sought his extradition on criminal charges.
SEC attorney Laura Meehan told jurors during closing arguments that the platform’s success story was “built on lies.”
“If you swing big and you miss, and you don’t tell people that you came up short, that is fraud,” Meehan said.
The SEC has said Kwon and Terraform secretly arranged to have a third party purchase large amounts of TerraUSD to prop up the price when the stablecoin slipped from its peg a year earlier, in May 2021. Kwon falsely attributed the recovery to the reliability of TerraUSD’s algorithms, according to the regulator.
The SEC also has said Kwon and Terraform falsely touted Terraform’s blockchain as being used to process and settle transactions between customers and merchants on the Chai payment app.
Louis Pellegrino, an attorney for Terraform, said in closing arguments that the SEC’s case relied on statements taken out of context and that Terraform and Kwon had been truthful about their products and how they worked, even when they failed.
“Terraform is still out there, trying to rebuild and make purchasers whole,” Pellegrino said.
Earlier in the case, Terraform argued that securities laws did not apply to the cryptocurrencies it developed. Rakoff rejected that argument in December, ruling that Terraform unlawfully sold digital assets without registering them as securities.
After a final judgment in the case, Terraform will be able to challenge that ruling on appeal.

‘They hit the jackpot’: How so-called ‘burglary tourists’ use visa waivers to target luxury US homes
Carol and Jeff Starr celebrated their daughter’s wedding last month with a bit of irony: neither was wearing their own wedding rings at the ceremony. Thieves had broken into their Southern California home last spring and cleaned out a safe full of jewelry.
“They hit the jackpot,” Carol Starr told CNN.
The couple had locked their own rings in a 6-foot-tall safe, where they also secured heirloom jewelry passed down from Carol’s late mother.
“My mother loved beautiful things and she wanted to leave a legacy through jewelry,” Carol Starr said. “She bought some beautiful antique jewelry, museum-quality jewelry.”
Orange County, California, prosecutors allege a group of thieves hid in the hillside adjoining the Starr’s home, watched them leave with visiting relatives, and made their move.
“They came over our fence, they broke through a window in the upper bedroom and came through that window,” Jeff Starr told CNN. “And then immediately started working … on the safe.”
The total loss: a staggering $8 million, the family estimates.
“You don’t feel safe in your own home anymore,” said Carol Starr, who is thankful no one returned home during the burglary. “I get so emotional and so mad when I think about what could have happened.”
Prosecutors say the break-in is part of a larger issue in which so-called “burglary tourists” enter the United States from countries that qualify for visa waivers, allowing a visit of up to 90 days without a traditional tourist visa. When the suspects arrive – most often from South America, prosecutors say – they join sophisticated burglary rings that prey on luxury homes.
In some cases, the suspects “lie in wait in these ghillie suits so they remain camouflaged,” said Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer. “They take advantage of the fact that most people don’t have window sensors or motion detectors on their second floors. They have WiFi jammers to stop the alarm company from being notified.”
Spitzer said the stolen goods are often sold quickly and the money is sent back to the suspect’s home country. Most often, that’s Chile, he said, which is now the only remaining South American country that qualifies for the Department of Homeland Security’s waiver program, known as the “Electronic System for Travel Authorization,” or ESTA.
The problem extends beyond California. Last month police in Scottsdale, Arizona, reported they arrested three Chilean nationals in connection with what authorities called a “burglary series” in the city.
Within the last year, police in Baltimore, Maryland; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Nassau County, New York, were among those announcing arrests in cases of luxury home burglaries linked to Chilean nationals in the US on visa waivers.

While there is no formal tally of the number of crimes committed by “burglary tourists,” the number appears to be, at minimum, in the hundreds. Ventura County, California, alone attributed 175 residential burglaries to “transnational theft groups” between 2019 and mid-2023.
“Not all Chileans are coming to the United States on this 90-days tourist program … not all of them are committing crimes,” Scottsdale Police Chief Jeff Walther noted in a March news conference. “I’m not saying that they are … But what we’re getting is hundreds, hundreds if not thousands coming in through the visa waiver program that are committing residential burglaries in dozens and dozens and dozens of cities and neighborhoods around the country. This is not a Scottsdale issue, this is not a Valley issue, this is not an Arizona issue. This is a national issue.”
Walther added: “We have to be willing to start asking some hard questions of our federal government about the visa waiver program.”
Seeking answers from South America
Rama and Balakrishna Sundar built their dream home overlooking the ocean in Dana Point, California. After alleged “burglary tourists” broke in through a bedroom window last year, they are trying to re-build their peace of mind.
“We want to move away from here and I don’t feel very secure at all,” Rama Sundar told CNN.
The burglars also took a sledgehammer to an elevator door, perhaps thinking a safe was behind it, Balakrishna Sundar said. When the alarm company was notified, the burglars fled with nothing valuable. The suspects were Chilean nationals, and at least one of them was out on bail for another crime, according to a complaint filed in Orange County.
Spitzer, the district attorney, has been a vocal critic of Chile, claiming it isn’t releasing background information on those granted visa waivers, which hinders prosecution here in the US.
“If we don’t know the criminal background of these individuals … then we can’t tell the judge anything or represent anything about the background,” he said. “Which means the person is released on no bail and they never come back again to answer for the charges.”
The Chilean government did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
The Department of Homeland Security’s website says the waiver program is vital for “expanding economic and cultural ties.” More than 40 countries qualify for the program.
In a statement to CNN, the department acknowledged it is “deeply concerned with some individuals who travel to the United States and engage in criminal activity,” but adds “Chilean officials have responded by improving operational cooperation with DHS to prevent travel … by known criminal actors.”
The agency also noted it is expediting biometric information sharing between the US and Chile that, once fully implemented, will give US officials access to the criminal histories of travelers.

In March, Spitzer sued the US State Department, demanding to see the details of a bilateral security agreement for preventing and combating serious crime that it signed with Chile in July.
“Where’s the proof in the pudding?” said Spitzer. “How come we’re not seeing a significant diminishment of these burglaries?”
The Sundar family also questioned the level of urgency on this issue in Washington.
“I want a politician to go through this experience and he may feel exactly as I feel,” Balakrishna Sundar said.
“They’re supposed to help us,” his wife added. “It’s very annoying and disturbing.”

Taiwan shaken but unbowed as biggest quake in 25 years spotlights preparedness — and lessons learned
Wu was preparing breakfast for guests at the small hotel he runs in Taiwan’s Hualien County when the shelves around him shook violently and the mountain behind his house roared.
Fearing the building would collapse, he rushed his guests to safety outdoors. Across the river, steep slopes were slipping from the mountains, the air swallowed by clouds of dust.
But Wu’s house suffered little damage from Wednesday’s 7.4 magnitude tremor, Taiwan’s most powerful in 25 years, something he attributes to a wider push to make the island more quake-resistant.
“Our government conducted a comprehensive review of building codes after the 1999 earthquake, and all buildings going up must use new technologies that make them more resilient to earthquakes,” he says.
Fifteen years ago when he started building his two-story guesthouse near the entrance to Taroko Gorge – a national park famed for its steep, marble-walled canyons – Wu had to get government approval of its earthquake-preparedness.
And experts say changes like this have helped the tremor-prone island avoid mass casualties in quakes like the one that hit on Wednesday.
“I feel very lucky,” says Wu of the remarkably low-level damage wrought by the massive quake. “It’s not too bad.”
It’s a similar story in Hualien, a city just 11 miles from the epicenter, which looks strikingly calm the day after the tremor.
Stores and restaurants have reopened, as have roadside stalls selling fruit, vegetables and snacks. Trains to the city, suspended as a precaution on Wednesday, have resumed and are running on schedule.
The most potent sign of the quake is a 10-story red-brick tower in the city center, leaning precariously at a 45-degree angle after its ground floor collapsed. Excavators have heaped rubble at the base of the Uranus Building, to prop it up.
Emergency workers have started repairing dozens of damaged buildings and demolishing four deemed impossible to save. But for the most part, the city of 100,000 people on Taiwan’s scenic east coast has emerged unscathed.
That is not to understate the earthquake’s power. Taiwan’s seismologists describe the tremor as having an energy equivalent to 32 of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima. It rocked the entire island of Taiwan and was felt as far away as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Chong, a 52-year-old housekeeper, said she had lived through plenty of earthquakes in Hualien. “But the scale of this earthquake was very frightening,” she said. “I’ve never experienced an earthquake this big in my 50 years here in Hualien.”
Wednesday’s earthquake shook more parts of Taiwan with greater intensity than any other quake since 1999, when a 7.7 magnitude tremor hit the middle of the island, killing 2,400 people and injuring 10,000 others.
But this time, the number of casualties is much lower. As of Thursday, 10 people had been killed and just over 1,000 were injured, while two dozen remained missing, according to authorities.
“It is a pretty miraculous outcome,” said Daniel Aldrich, a professor of political science and public policy at Northeastern University who studies the resilience of cities, calling the toll “a very low number of deaths by a strong, powerful earthquake near an urban center.”
“The other disasters around 7.5 (magnitude) have caused far more casualties than we’ve seen so far in Taiwan,” he said, citing the tens of thousands of deaths during previous quakes in Haiti, India and China.
‘We grew up with quakes’
Wednesday’s quake struck Taiwan’s rural east coast. The island’s west is where most people live, home to the largest cities, an extensive high-speed rail network and much of the industrial heartland.
Most of the destruction – and deaths – occurred in remote rural areas in the wider Hualien County.
The victims were mostly killed outdoors by falling rocks or landslides. Four of them were hiking in Taroko Gorge, four died on mountainous highways, and another was working at a remote quarry, according to authorities.
So far, only one person was killed in a collapsed building – the Uranus Building in downtown Hualien. She initially escaped but went back to rescue her pet cat, CNN affiliate SET reported.
Taiwan’s recent push for preparedness comes from the hard lessons learned from the devastating quake 25 years ago, experts say.
When the earthquake struck in 1999, Taiwan was very unprepared, Aldrich said, citing corruption in the construction industry, the lack of building regulations, and inadequate coordination in rescue efforts.
That quake left more than 100,000 buildings across Taiwan completely or partially collapsed, including nearly 300 schools. Buildings were also flattened in the capital Taipei, about 100 miles from the epicenter.
“What we’ve seen since then are massive upgrades across the board, what I would call a top-down on a bottom-up set of responses,” Aldrich said.
From the top down, the government strengthened disaster management laws, improved coordination for rescue and relief, and enforced stricter building codes for earthquake resistance.
“They’ve issued massive fines and penalties for construction firms found to have in any way cut corners on their construction. And there has been a really serious investment in all the new buildings,” Aldrich said.
The government launched a campaign to evaluate, retrofit or rebuild public buildings to enhance their ability to withstand stronger quakes, with schools being a priority. The campaign has since extended to private buildings, such as Wu’s.
September 21 – the date the deadly earthquake struck in 1999 – is now a designated day for disaster drills in Taiwan, with mock alert messages sent to mobile phones across the island and schools staging evacuation exercises.
The mayor of Hualien, Wei Chia-yen, attributes the relatively low death toll in his city to advanced preparation.
“Here in Hualien, we grew up with earthquakes,” he said inside a gymnasium turned shelter at a primary school, set up within hours of the quake.
Rows of tents have been put up for residents whose homes have been damaged, or who are afraid to return due to aftershocks, while boxes of food and drinks are spread out on the tables.
Wei was himself injured by a cabinet falling on his left leg and was using crutches to get around the shelter.
“Our teachers and relatives always taught us how to react when earthquakes strike,” he said. “So we’ve known about this since we were kids.”

Taiwan shaken but unbowed as biggest quake in 25 years spotlights preparedness — and lessons learned
Wu was preparing breakfast for guests at the small hotel he runs in Taiwan’s Hualien County when the shelves around him shook violently and the mountain behind his house roared.
Fearing the building would collapse, he rushed his guests to safety outdoors. Across the river, steep slopes were slipping from the mountains, the air swallowed by clouds of dust.
But Wu’s house suffered little damage from Wednesday’s 7.4 magnitude tremor, Taiwan’s most powerful in 25 years, something he attributes to a wider push to make the island more quake-resistant.
“Our government conducted a comprehensive review of building codes after the 1999 earthquake, and all buildings going up must use new technologies that make them more resilient to earthquakes,” he says.
Fifteen years ago when he started building his two-story guesthouse near the entrance to Taroko Gorge – a national park famed for its steep, marble-walled canyons – Wu had to get government approval of its earthquake-preparedness.
And experts say changes like this have helped the tremor-prone island avoid mass casualties in quakes like the one that hit on Wednesday.
“I feel very lucky,” says Wu of the remarkably low-level damage wrought by the massive quake. “It’s not too bad.”
It’s a similar story in Hualien, a city just 11 miles from the epicenter, which looks strikingly calm the day after the tremor.
Stores and restaurants have reopened, as have roadside stalls selling fruit, vegetables and snacks. Trains to the city, suspended as a precaution on Wednesday, have resumed and are running on schedule.
The most potent sign of the quake is a 10-story red-brick tower in the city center, leaning precariously at a 45-degree angle after its ground floor collapsed. Excavators have heaped rubble at the base of the Uranus Building, to prop it up.
Emergency workers have started repairing dozens of damaged buildings and demolishing four deemed impossible to save. But for the most part, the city of 100,000 people on Taiwan’s scenic east coast has emerged unscathed.
That is not to understate the earthquake’s power. Taiwan’s seismologists describe the tremor as having an energy equivalent to 32 of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima. It rocked the entire island of Taiwan and was felt as far away as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Chong, a 52-year-old housekeeper, said she had lived through plenty of earthquakes in Hualien. “But the scale of this earthquake was very frightening,” she said. “I’ve never experienced an earthquake this big in my 50 years here in Hualien.”
Wednesday’s earthquake shook more parts of Taiwan with greater intensity than any other quake since 1999, when a 7.7 magnitude tremor hit the middle of the island, killing 2,400 people and injuring 10,000 others.
But this time, the number of casualties is much lower. As of Thursday, 10 people had been killed and just over 1,000 were injured, while two dozen remained missing, according to authorities.
“It is a pretty miraculous outcome,” said Daniel Aldrich, a professor of political science and public policy at Northeastern University who studies the resilience of cities, calling the toll “a very low number of deaths by a strong, powerful earthquake near an urban center.”
“The other disasters around 7.5 (magnitude) have caused far more casualties than we’ve seen so far in Taiwan,” he said, citing the tens of thousands of deaths during previous quakes in Haiti, India and China.
‘We grew up with quakes’
Wednesday’s quake struck Taiwan’s rural east coast. The island’s west is where most people live, home to the largest cities, an extensive high-speed rail network and much of the industrial heartland.
Most of the destruction – and deaths – occurred in remote rural areas in the wider Hualien County.
The victims were mostly killed outdoors by falling rocks or landslides. Four of them were hiking in Taroko Gorge, four died on mountainous highways, and another was working at a remote quarry, according to authorities.
So far, only one person was killed in a collapsed building – the Uranus Building in downtown Hualien. She initially escaped but went back to rescue her pet cat, CNN affiliate SET reported.
Taiwan’s recent push for preparedness comes from the hard lessons learned from the devastating quake 25 years ago, experts say.
When the earthquake struck in 1999, Taiwan was very unprepared, Aldrich said, citing corruption in the construction industry, the lack of building regulations, and inadequate coordination in rescue efforts.
That quake left more than 100,000 buildings across Taiwan completely or partially collapsed, including nearly 300 schools. Buildings were also flattened in the capital Taipei, about 100 miles from the epicenter.
“What we’ve seen since then are massive upgrades across the board, what I would call a top-down on a bottom-up set of responses,” Aldrich said.
From the top down, the government strengthened disaster management laws, improved coordination for rescue and relief, and enforced stricter building codes for earthquake resistance.
“They’ve issued massive fines and penalties for construction firms found to have in any way cut corners on their construction. And there has been a really serious investment in all the new buildings,” Aldrich said.
The government launched a campaign to evaluate, retrofit or rebuild public buildings to enhance their ability to withstand stronger quakes, with schools being a priority. The campaign has since extended to private buildings, such as Wu’s.

Boebert continues stoking controversy amid intense battle to keep her job
Three months after Rep. Lauren Boebert apologized for disruptive conduct at a Denver theater, the Colorado Republican attended a glitzy Republican gala headlined by former President Donald Trump in Manhattan, where her behavior once again raised eyebrows.
At the December soiree, which was the New York Young Republican Club’s annual gala, multiple witnesses saw a server tell Boebert they would not bring her any more alcohol, with one witness telling CNN the server told the congresswoman they believed she had been overserved. Throughout the night, Boebert also kept attempting to snap selfies with Trump, who was sitting at the same table as her. Eventually, Trump’s security detail stepped in and asked Boebert to stop, according to the witnesses, who attended the event and saw the interaction take place.
Trump, however, still gave Boebert his full and total endorsement last month, which Boebert’s allies say is proof he clearly wasn’t very bothered by the incident. They also say her boisterous and loud personality can sometimes be misconstrued, especially by people who don’t know her well. CNN has reached out to Boebert’s office for comment.
But as Boebert desperately fights to keep her congressional career alive, the MAGA firebrand will need to dispel concerns about her controversial behavior – and accusations of carpetbagging – as she tries to convince voters in an entirely new district that she is best suited to represent a rural seat in eastern Colorado. Her allies, though, insist her congressional reputation will not be defined by her personal life, even if not everyone always agrees with her style.
“It hasn’t encumbered her job performance,” GOP Rep. Byron Donalds of Florida told CNN. “Look, some of that stuff that popped up wasn’t the best stuff to see. Even she acknowledges that. But none of us are perfect. Just because we’re elected officials doesn’t mean we’re any more perfect than anybody else. Stuff happens. But I think she has been able to do her job, and that’s all that matters at the end of the day.”
For her part, Boebert is leaning on her record as conservative congresswoman. That record includes getting the Pueblo Jobs Act signed into law, a bill the congresswoman has said will create a thousand new jobs in the area. She also has been participating in dozens of forums in the district. And Boebert, who has a hefty campaign war chest, is already up with her first TV ad touting Trump’s endorsement. But it’s a tricky balancing act for the embattled congresswoman as she tries to tone down her public image and prove she is a serious legislator without backing down from her identity as a flame-throwing MAGA warrior.
“Every day is hard. I’m not afraid of a challenge though,” Boebert told CNN before the House left for a two-week break. “I mean, I think that’s what has always caused me to stand out because there is always something coming against me, always something in my way. And when times get tough, I get tougher.”
“I show that we can persevere and push through. I got my boys, I got my faith,” she added.
Boebert has also faced personal challenges, including a recent health issue. The congresswoman underwent emergency surgery for a blood clot in her leg and has been diagnosed with May-Thurner syndrome, her campaign announced earlier this week. The campaign said Boebert is expected to make a full recovery.
Boebert gets boost in reelection bid amid political and personal challenges
Boebert has been navigating a political rollercoaster over the past few months. After narrowly defeating a Democrat last cycle, she opted to run in more conservative-leaning terrain in Colorado’s 4th district, where former Rep. Ken Buck had announced he was retiring, instead of seeking re-election to her current seat in the 3rd district.
Boebert says the decision to relocate was based on personal reasons – namely, wanting a fresh start following a messy and public divorce – and not politically motivated, though the move undoubtedly better positioned her re-election chances.
But Buck threw a wrench into her plans last month when he decided to resign early, teeing up a special election to fill the remainder of his term on June 25 – the same day as the Republican primary for the general election this fall – and putting Boebert in an unenviable position.
If Boebert had decided to run for the vacant seat, she would have needed to give up her current one, a risky decision that would have also further shrunk the House’s already razor thin majority. But if the vacancy committee, which is made up of a panel of Colorado Republicans, had selected one of her primary competitors to fill the seat, it would have given that person a major edge in the primary contest.
Boebert ultimately decided not to run for the vacancy, and the gamble paid off: last week, the vacancy committee wound up selecting a placeholder candidate, Greg Lopez, who is not running this fall. The move provided a big and unexpected boost for Boebert, who had sent a letter to the committee before the meeting imploring them not to tip the scales by tapping someone who was also planning to run in the primary. Now, it becomes a more even playing field, which Boebert celebrated on social media.
“Greg stepped up with a servant heart and a leadership mindset with accountability being his driving force,” Boebert wrote on X after the meeting. “I look forward to serving the remainder of the 118th Congress with my soon to be colleague!”
But Boebert still has to prevail in the packed primary in June. Nearly a dozen Republican candidates have jumped into the race, though not all of them may appear on the ballot in June and only half a dozen are considered serious contenders. And sources close to Boebert believe a more crowded field of rivals may actually benefit Boebert by splitting up the rest of the vote.
Whoever wins the Republican primary is the heavy favorite to win this November, though at least one Democratic candidate running in the district believes it will be competitive if Boebert becomes the nominee. But even though it’s a reliable Republican seat, having Trump’s endorsement is not enough to carry a candidate over the finish line, according to a GOP strategist familiar with the district, which is heavily populated with ranchers and farmers who see agriculture policy as a top priority. Boebert herself came to Congress by defeating a Republican congressman in the primary who was endorsed by Trump.
“They all like Trump (in the district), they want someone supportive of Trump, but they’re not gonna vote based just off Trump,” the strategist said. “You’ve got to say you’re gonna work with him and you can’t be anti-Trump, but his endorsement alone is not gonna win the race.”
Boebert gets back up in feud with Buck
Still, Boebert has some powerful allies in her corner. Aside from Trump, she also has the support of Speaker Mike Johnson, who hosted a fundraiser for the congresswoman earlier this year and has made an effort to protect embattled incumbents in primaries, according to a source familiar with the event.
And the far-right House Freedom Caucus is also rallying around Boebert, whom they view as a crucial champion for their cause. Members have been encouraged to contribute to her campaign and some members are in talks about traveling out to Boebert’s district to help support her, according to sources familiar with the situation.
The Freedom Caucus also took another step that was seen as running defense for Boebert. Days before Buck was set to leave Congress, the Freedom Caucus voted to boot Buck from their ranks. The official reason was cited as attendance issues, but many in the group – Boebert included – believe Buck purposely resigned early in an attempt to sabotage Boebert’s re-election chances . And kicking him out of the group was seen as a form of symbolic payback, even if it had little practical impact.
“There’s been discussion of his removal for a very long time now. He doesn’t reflect the Freedom Caucus, and it hasn’t for quite some time. And unfortunately, I’ve had a front row seat,” Boebert told CNN. “He was somebody who I expected to be a mentor for me, but it just never happened. You know, he actually wrote my favorite political book, ‘Drain the Swamp.’ And I think maybe I should send him a copy and he should re-read it.”
Buck denies that the timing of his resignation was designed to kneecap Boebert in any way.
“I did it because we don’t have to have two separate elections and cost the taxpayers two separate elections,” he told CNN. “I have scrupulously avoided commenting on that race, just because I don’t want people to think I’m taking one side or the other.”
While Boebert has publicly feuded with other Republican lawmakers – including GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene – she has found close allies inside the Freedom Caucus. GOP lawmakers who are close to Boebert describe someone who is fun to be around and is known to crack self-deprecating jokes about her situation. But whether that’s a quality that will matter to voters remains to be seen.
“She’s fun at a party. She’s been really cool. And she’s probably made more jokes about her own stupidity in that movie theater than I’ve heard elsewhere,” one GOP lawmaker told CNN. “I was critical of her at first, but now I am quite comfortable around her. To me, Lauren has gotten to be better.”

Comic featuring Superman’s first ever appearance sells for record $6 million
A 1938 comic featuring Superman’s first appearance sold for $6 million at auction on Thursday, becoming the most expensive comic ever, according to Heritage Auctions, which handled the sale.
The auction house dubbed it the “most important, impactful comic book ever published,” as it introduced the world to Superman for just 10 cents an issue when it was first released 86 years ago.
“Without Superman and Action Comics No. 1, who knows whether there ever would have been a Golden Age of comics—or if the medium would have become what it is today,” Heritage Auctions Vice President Barry Sandoval said in a statement ahead of the sale.
And despite its age, this comic was still in very good condition, with rich colors and a little wear at the top. Only two other unrestored copies exist in better condition, Heritage Auctions said, and only 100 in total are estimated to survive out of the 200,000 originally printed.
The story, written by friends Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, reveals Superman’s origins as an alien child sent to Earth to escape the destruction of his planet, and introduces his love interest, Lois Lane.
Such is the value of this particular issue that loose individual pages have fetched up to $60,000 each, the auction house added. Other copies have also sold for record-breaking prices, including one in 2021 that went for $3.25 million and became the most expensive ever comic at the time.
The first ever comic featuring Spider-Man overtook it later the same year, when it sold for $3.6 million, according to CGC Comics, before another issue of the Man of Steel’s adventures in “Superman #1” took the crown in 2022, fetching $5.3 million in a private sale.
In the years since his first appearance, Superman has become one of the most recognizable and enduring characters in American pop culture, spawning blockbuster movies, books, toys, and even bubble gum.

While many flock to see the eclipse, these cultures are doing something different
For many people, the upcoming total solar eclipse is a joyous and celebratory occasion.
Countless skygazers are gearing up to witness the rare cosmological marvel as it crosses over Mexico, the US and Canada on April 8. Along with the 30 or so million people living in the path of totality, millions more are expected to travel for a better view. Crowds will gather at eclipse watch parties to cheer on as the moon passes between Earth and the sun, and hundreds of couples plan to mark the phenomenon by tying the knot.
But in other cultures and faith traditions, an eclipse is less spectacle and more spiritual. Some take time to meditate and reflect on the universe, while others engage in rituals to ward off negative energies.
Here’s how some religions and cultures observe this celestial event.
Some Hindus see eclipses as a bad omen
Some Hindus, especially those with roots in South India, consider eclipses a bad omen, says Sangeetha Kowsik, a Hindu chaplain and spiritual life advisor at New York University. In Vedic astrology, an eclipse occurs when the shadow planet Rahu swallows the sun.
One interpretation from Hindu scriptures references an episode known as the churning of the ocean, which produces a nectar of immortality, Kowsik explains. Vishnu, one of the principal Hindu deities, transforms into the female avatar Mohini and distributes the nectar to the gods. The serpent demon Svarbhanu, however, sits between the sun and the moon and obtains the nectar under false pretenses.
When the sun and the moon alert Vishnu to this deception, Vishnu decapitates the demon — the head becomes Rahu and the body becomes Ketu. Having drunk the nectar, Rahu becomes immortal while Ketu dies. In his anger, Rahu attempts to swallow the sun and the moon, producing an eclipse.
Some Hindus who see eclipses as inauspicious fast before and bathe after the celestial event — sometimes with their clothes on — to clear themselves of negative energies, Kowsik says. Some temples, meanwhile, close down during the eclipse and offer special prayers.
But Hinduism encompasses a wide range of spiritual beliefs, practices and traditions, and not all Hindus view eclipses as negative. According to other Hindu legends, all nine planets of Vedic astrology are said to live in the belly of the god Ganesha or in the tail of the god Hanuman.
“So if you are a Ganesha devotee or a Hanuman devotee, all of these effects of these planets are gone because God is there to save you,” Kowsik says. “God is there to take care of you always and eradicate any issue that you might have.”
Kowsik, meanwhile, feels torn on how she’ll mark the upcoming eclipse.
“It doesn’t happen that often, and I don’t know if I should stay indoors,” she adds. “I’m a big believer in Lord Ganesha and Lord Hanuman and God in general, so I might take a look because I think it’s going to look really cool, personally.”
Muslims consider eclipses a sign from God
For many Muslims, eclipses are a time for prayer and spiritual contemplation, says Akif Aydin, president of the interfaith organization Atlantic Institute SC.
Per Islamic tradition, the Prophet Muhammad’s young son Ibrahim died on the day of a solar eclipse, and many of his followers at the time associated the celestial phenomenon with death and sorrow, Aydin says.
But the Prophet was quick to dispute such notions, declaring that an eclipse was merely a sign from God — not a harbinger of life or death. The Prophet Muhammad encouraged his followers to remember and worship God during an eclipse, inviting his disciples to worship with him at the mosque until the cosmic event passed, says Aydin.
“It is a time to connect with God again — to remember God’s creation again,” he adds.
Aydin says he plans to watch the upcoming eclipse from his backyard in South Carolina with his wife, four children and nieces. As the sky darkens, he’ll roll out a rug on the grass and bow down in prayer.
Some Christians believe it signals the second coming of Christ
In the eyes of some Christians, the solar eclipse is a sign that the “end times” — the period prophesied in the Bible when Jesus Christ will return to Earth — are imminent.
The New Testament of the Bible contains several mentions of the sky darkening while Jesus was hung on the cross, which some believers associate with a solar eclipse.
“From noon until three in the afternoon darkness came over all the land,” a passage from Matthew 27 reads. “About three in the afternoon Jesus cried out in a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” (which means “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”)”
Celestial phenomena such as eclipses are often accompanied by end times predictions, though some authors and scholars point out that such prophecies are usually rooted in North American evangelical ideas around the apocalypse.
“But while some passages in the Bible do link astronomical phenomena with “the end” (Matthew 24:29; Joel 2:31), doomsday prophets fail to explain why their biblical, global, and cosmic calculus often revolves around America,” author and pastor Andrea L. Robinson writes in Christianity Today.
“They further neglect the fact that an eclipse happens somewhere on Earth approximately every 18 months—and that these solar events have been associated with imminent doom for thousands of years without consequence.”
For Navajos, it’s a time of reverence
While many towns and cities will be abuzz on Monday with people trying to catch a glimpse of the eclipse, the Navajo Nation reservation will be more still.
Eclipses are a more solemn occasion in Navajo tradition, according to Evelyn Bahe, a program manager in the Department of Diné Education in Window Rock, Arizona. The Diné, the term Navajos use to refer to themselves, see the celestial event as a time to show reverence and respect for the sun and the Earth.
“During the eclipse, we have to get back into our dwelling, close the curtains and make it really quiet,” Bahe says. “During this time, we cannot eat. We cannot sleep. We cannot drink water.”
Engaging in these activities during an eclipse is said to negatively affect a person and disrupt their spiritual harmony, Bahe adds. During previous eclipses, offices, parks and schools on the Navajo Nation have closed to honor the cosmic phenomenon.
Bahe says Navajos have varying explanations for what happens during an eclipse: Some consider it a meeting of the sun and the moon — others view it as a rebirth and renewal of the celestial bodies.
“It is considered a time of interaction between the Sun and the moon,” the Indigenous Education Institute’s Nancy C. Maryboy and David Begay say in a statement on the Exploratorium website.
“(Navajo elders) sit quietly and in contemplation, or recount traditional teachings about the origins of the Sun and moon. These practices are grounded in their deeply held respect for the cosmic order.”

While many flock to see the eclipse, these cultures are doing something different
For many people, the upcoming total solar eclipse is a joyous and celebratory occasion.
Countless skygazers are gearing up to witness the rare cosmological marvel as it crosses over Mexico, the US and Canada on April 8. Along with the 30 or so million people living in the path of totality, millions more are expected to travel for a better view. Crowds will gather at eclipse watch parties to cheer on as the moon passes between Earth and the sun, and hundreds of couples plan to mark the phenomenon by tying the knot.
But in other cultures and faith traditions, an eclipse is less spectacle and more spiritual. Some take time to meditate and reflect on the universe, while others engage in rituals to ward off negative energies.
Here’s how some religions and cultures observe this celestial event.
Some Hindus see eclipses as a bad omen
Some Hindus, especially those with roots in South India, consider eclipses a bad omen, says Sangeetha Kowsik, a Hindu chaplain and spiritual life advisor at New York University. In Vedic astrology, an eclipse occurs when the shadow planet Rahu swallows the sun.
One interpretation from Hindu scriptures references an episode known as the churning of the ocean, which produces a nectar of immortality, Kowsik explains. Vishnu, one of the principal Hindu deities, transforms into the female avatar Mohini and distributes the nectar to the gods. The serpent demon Svarbhanu, however, sits between the sun and the moon and obtains the nectar under false pretenses.
When the sun and the moon alert Vishnu to this deception, Vishnu decapitates the demon — the head becomes Rahu and the body becomes Ketu. Having drunk the nectar, Rahu becomes immortal while Ketu dies. In his anger, Rahu attempts to swallow the sun and the moon, producing an eclipse.
Some Hindus who see eclipses as inauspicious fast before and bathe after the celestial event — sometimes with their clothes on — to clear themselves of negative energies, Kowsik says. Some temples, meanwhile, close down during the eclipse and offer special prayers.
But Hinduism encompasses a wide range of spiritual beliefs, practices and traditions, and not all Hindus view eclipses as negative. According to other Hindu legends, all nine planets of Vedic astrology are said to live in the belly of the god Ganesha or in the tail of the god Hanuman.
“So if you are a Ganesha devotee or a Hanuman devotee, all of these effects of these planets are gone because God is there to save you,” Kowsik says. “God is there to take care of you always and eradicate any issue that you might have.”
Kowsik, meanwhile, feels torn on how she’ll mark the upcoming eclipse.
“It doesn’t happen that often, and I don’t know if I should stay indoors,” she adds. “I’m a big believer in Lord Ganesha and Lord Hanuman and God in general, so I might take a look because I think it’s going to look really cool, personally.”
Muslims consider eclipses a sign from God
For many Muslims, eclipses are a time for prayer and spiritual contemplation, says Akif Aydin, president of the interfaith organization Atlantic Institute SC.
Per Islamic tradition, the Prophet Muhammad’s young son Ibrahim died on the day of a solar eclipse, and many of his followers at the time associated the celestial phenomenon with death and sorrow, Aydin says.
But the Prophet was quick to dispute such notions, declaring that an eclipse was merely a sign from God — not a harbinger of life or death. The Prophet Muhammad encouraged his followers to remember and worship God during an eclipse, inviting his disciples to worship with him at the mosque until the cosmic event passed, says Aydin.
“It is a time to connect with God again — to remember God’s creation again,” he adds.
Aydin says he plans to watch the upcoming eclipse from his backyard in South Carolina with his wife, four children and nieces. As the sky darkens, he’ll roll out a rug on the grass and bow down in prayer.

New calculations have raised concerns popular eclipse maps might be off. Here’s what scientists say
If you’re planning to see the epic total solar eclipse that will dance across the skies of North America on Monday, you should aim to travel as close to the center of the celestial spectacle’s path as possible.
New map calculations have raised some concerns that the path of totality — where it’s possible to see the moon completely block out the sun — is slightly narrower than NASA calculated. That means some cities on the edge of the route that were expecting to experience a second or two of total darkness might be left out.
NASA has not changed its predictions, but the space agency advises that there is some uncertainty involved in mapping the eclipse’s path.
“Calculations that use a slightly larger radius for the size of the Sun yield an eclipse path that is slightly narrower,” said NASA spokesperson Karen Fox in an emailed statement. “This difference would only affect cities on the very edge of the path of totality, where blanket predictions are difficult regardless — a few city blocks one way or the other could mean 20, 10, or 0 seconds of totality.”
And for viewing purposes, NASA scientists and other experts recommend that spectators head for the middle, rather than the perimeter, of the path anyway.
“I would never, never be near the edge of where that totality is because it’s a difference between night and day,” said Dr. Edward Guinan, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Villanova University.
Mapping the moment
Recent questions around a potentially shifting path have focused on a new map calculated by Guildford, England-based software developer John Irwin and published to a webpage called Besselian Elements.
The research hasn’t been thoroughly reviewed by scientists, Guinan said. And even if the NASA map is wrong, Irwin’s calculations indicate it’s only off by a couple thousand feet on the edges.
Irwin did not immediately respond to an email request for comment Friday.
But few things in science are ever certain. And NASA also acknowledges that exact measurements of the eclipse path are difficult to pin down.
“(P)recise eclipse prediction has brought new attention to a tiny but real uncertainty about the size of the Sun,” NASA’s statement reads. “Uncertainty in the Earth’s rotation can also affect eclipse predictions on this level.”
Guinan explained that it’s extremely difficult to determine an exact measurement of the sun’s size because “it’s a fuzzy surface.”
He noted that the sun could be slightly enlarged right now because the our star is currently going through a period of maximum magnetic activity, which “could cause the sun to swell out a bit.”
But the uncertainty accounts for only a few hundred feet, while the moon is millions of miles across.
Still, even slight adjustments in the sun’s size could gently alter the edges of the moon’s shadow on Monday.
Edge effects
The Besselian Elements website advertises that people should consult Irwin’s alternative eclipse map if they’re hoping to travel to the edge of the path — where the length of total darkness may be extremely brief but onlookers could catch a prolonged glimpse of various other eclipse-related phenomenon.
Guinan notes that eclipses do offer “edge effects.”
“You wouldn’t see the total eclipse, but you would see this diamond ring effect — flashes of the sun going in and out behind mountains and coming through valleys on the moon,” he said. “That would be kind of cool to do if you have seen a lot of eclipses.”
“But I don’t recommend people do this,” he said.
NASA also said in its statement, “Traveling towards the center of the path of totality — even a mile or two — will quickly increase the length of totality that people can see.”
And totality is the real show, Guinan emphasized.
This phase of the eclipse will plunge the area into darkness. The temperature will drop. Animals will behave as if it’s nightfall. The sun’s corona — or its blazing hot, outer atmosphere — will be visible. Bright stars and planets will shine in the surrounding sky.
“When you see the total eclipse, you can’t go back,” Guinan said. “It’s spectacular.”

Unseen photos show a day in the life of Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love
Photographs by Guzman Story by Kyle AlmondPublished April 5, 2024
Kurt Cobain and Courtney Love lie in bed with their baby daughter, Frances Bean, in September 1992.
They were greeted at the front door by rock star Courtney Love, who welcomed them into the Los Angeles home she shared with her husband, Kurt Cobain.
She offered coffee and a slice of âjust deliveredâ guava pie.
Photographers Constance Hansen and Russell Peacock politely declined, eager to get to work. They were on assignment for Spin magazine, which was doing a cover story on the famous couple.
Love showed them around the house, a modest three-bedroom Craftsman in the Hollywood Heights neighborhood, as they waited for Cobain to come downstairs.
He never came down.
So instead, they went up to him.
When they got to Cobainâs room, they found the Nirvana frontman still in bed.
They introduced themselves and asked him if it was OK to take pictures. He nodded. He seemed unfazed by the whole thing. Meeting strangers in bed? No big deal, it seemed.
âThirty years later, we thought, well maybe that was the whole plan all along. Because he was wearing this fancy robe, and thatâs not something he would ever wear normally,â said Peacock, who along with Hansen forms the photography duo known simply as Guzman.
The photos that followed would come to be known as some of Cobainâs most famous. And a soon-to-be-released book, âFamily Values: Kurt, Courtney & Frances Bean,â includes nearly 100 photos from the day, most of which have never been published.
These photos were taken in September 1992, a year after the album âNevermindâ launched Nirvana â and Cobain â into superstardom. But over that time there were some personal struggles.
Cobain was in rehab for heroin addiction earlier in the month, and he had checked into a hospital a month before that to detox, according to Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad, who wrote the photo bookâs introduction. A story in Vanity Fair magazine, released weeks before this photo session, didnât paint the couple in the greatest light, and they were fighting for custody of their newborn daughter, Frances Bean. When Hansen and Peacock visited their home, there was a court-mandated nanny there.
The Spin magazine story gave the rock stars a chance to reframe the narrative.
When Hansen and Peacock were first given the assignment, they came up with a fun premise they thought they might try at first.
âWe were going to (show) them homemaking, doing domestic chores and things like that,â Hansen remembers. âWe were laughing on the way out (to Los Angeles). We were like, yeah, theyâll be mowing the lawn or ironing or cooking.â
Soon after arriving to the house, they quickly realized that wouldnât be the vibe. They followed their subjectsâ lead, and it all started with Cobain in bed.
It worked out for the best.
âPhotographing someone in bed is great, because theyâre vulnerable and itâs very personal,â Peacock said.
The duo took photos of Cobain and his room, which he said he was fine with. But he was never as comfortable in front of the camera as his wife was.
A short while later, Love came up with their baby girl and everything changed.
âHaving the baby there made a big difference, I think. It made him more open,â Peacock said. âAnd so it was kind of fortuitous to have the baby there. We kind of joked like, wow, we should bring babies on more shoots because they open people up.â
Now the entire family was in bed together, and Hansen remembers how beautiful it was to see everyone in sync. âThey just were loving Frances. It was really so apparent,â she said. âIt was really about her. They were oblivious to us in a lot of cases, anytime they had the baby.â
Eventually, everyone would come back downstairs for more photos, including individual portraits for both Cobain and Love.
At one point, Cobain grabbed a marker and began writing the words âfamily valuesâ on his wifeâs stomach. At the time in 1992, âfamily valuesâ was also a campaign theme for the Republican Party going into Novemberâs election.
âWe just went with it. We didnât know (what it meant),â Hansen said.
On his own stomach, Cobain wrote âdiet grrrl,â a play on words with the feminist punk movement âriot grrrl.â
Hansen and Peacock spent a few hours taking photos for what is now known among music fans as the âfamily valuesâ story. They often took photos simultaneously, and they used many different types of cameras and setups to get a variety of looks. Some are more polished and posed. Others are more gritty and spontaneous.
When the story was published by Spin, only a few images were included. The rest were tucked away in storage. Recently, friends from the LABspace gallery in New York asked Hansen and Peacock about that day and wanted to see more. The photos were exhibited at the gallery before becoming a book.
Many people remember the Spin article and tell the photographers that they had it on their wall when they were growing up.
âWe didnât realize the effect that those pictures had,â Hansen said.
The photos are now especially poignant because of Cobainâs tragic suicide.
Thirty years ago, in April 1994, Cobain took his own life at the age of 27. It was a shocking story that shook a generation of music fans.
âHe was an extraordinary musician and lyricist,â Hansen said. âHe was really different, too. He took it to another level. He wasnât derivative, He was just really special.â
Peacock said Cobain and Nirvana came at the perfect time, ushering in rockâs grunge era.
âThe timing was just right for that music, and it embedded itself in the culture like the Beatles or the Rolling Stones,â he said.
After Cobain died, Hansen and Peacock sent a few snapshots of him to Love at her request. They would later work with her on an album cover for her band Hole.
Theyâre looking forward to going on the book tour later this year, to hear more about how Cobain and Nirvana impacted lives. âTheir music still resonates with people,â Peacock said. âWe were in a coffee shop a couple weeks ago and thereâs a young girl in a Nirvana T-shirt. Itâs interesting.â
Working on the book has made the photographers think deeper about the Spin assignment and what might have been going on beneath the surface.
âI think there was a lot of vulnerability in the house at that moment,â Peacock said. âI didnât think about it at the time, but looking back, everything swirling around them, it must have been very intense to be so successful so quickly and struggle with that. Looking back, that feeling is there.â
The book âFamily Values: Kurt, Courtney & Frances Beanâ is being published by powerHouse Books and can now be pre-ordered.

A supercomputer is tracking one of most exciting soccer title races for years. It keeps coming up with different predictions
A supercomputer is tracking one of the most exciting English Premier League title races in years and with three clubs involved, separated by a matter of points, it keeps spitting out different predictions as it analyzes thousands of simulations.
While the supercomputer whirs away in the background, the 2023/2024 title race has been something to truly savour, with three powerhouses of English football – Liverpool, Arsenal and defending champion Manchester City – all in contention to win that prestigious crown.
“In the supercomputer’s latest round of 10,000 simulations of the rest of the Premier League season, Liverpool finished top of the pile 47.7% of the time,” said Opta Analyst after the three clubs had played their 29th league game.
“After the previous round of fixtures at the start of the month, Liverpool’s title chances were rated at 35.3%, meaning they increased by 12.4%.”
After Liverpool beat Sheffield United 3-1 on Thursday, there are now three points separating the top three with eight games remaining.
With all three teams now having played 30 matches, the Opta supercomputer is giving Liverpool a 45% chance of winning the league, Manchester City 33.6% and Arsenal 21.4%.
“Liverpool an 85.5% chance of winning that [Sheffield United] match, and so the fact that they struggled to break down the team set to break the Premier League record for goals conceded in a season appears to have hurt their title chances,” said Opta Analyst on Friday, adding that the Reds’ chances of winning the league had dropped from 47.7% to 45% after the midweek round of fixtures.
Liverpool leads the title race on 70 points, with Arsenal second on 68 and City third on 67. Arsenal has the superior goal difference of the three teams with +48, while Liverpool is on +42 and City +38.
Twists and turns
Liverpool’s result follows a successful night for Manchester City and Arsenal on Wednesday, with both teams easing to victories.
City looked to have arguably the toughest tie, facing an emerging Aston Villa which is bidding for a place in the Champions League next season.

The defending champion was also without key men Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland, who were rested ahead of Saturday’s league game against Crystal Palace and the team’s Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid on Tuesday.
But, in the absence of both stars, Phil Foden produced a masterclass to ensure his team kept pace with its title rivals, scoring three goals in a comfortable 4-1 win for City.
Whilst serving as another reminder of how good Foden has been this season – the Englishman has now scored 21 goals in all competitions, providing 10 assists – it was also a display of might from City which has a squad depth capable of winning a championship.
Meanwhile, Arsenal breezed to a 2-0 win over relegation-threatened Luton. Manager Mikel Arteta was able to rest some of his key players and still get the job done with relative ease, with Martin Ødegaard’s strike and an own goal was enough for the host.
In truth, after recent performances, it’s hard to see any of the top three dropping points until now and the end of the season.
But, if history tells us anything, they’ll be multiple twists and turns during the run-in.
Liverpool play Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, having lost 4-3 to its fierce rival in a FA Cup quarterfinal last month, and City boss Guardiola is aware of how close the remainder of the season it’s likely to be.
“If we win all our games it will be down to the last day because they are not five, six, seven points in front,” Guardiola said after the Aston Villa win.
Twice in recent years, City has only been confirmed champion on the final day of the season.
“It will not be easy. I see Liverpool and Arsenal dropping points but you never know,” added Guardiola.
“We have to show up and do our job and don’t regret that we should have won that game because they lost the game after.
“We cannot do anything. We cannot control what they do. We have to win our games, that’s all we can do.”
While City could win a fourth consecutive title, Arsenal is looking to win its first for 20 years.
For much of the two decades since Arsenal’s title-winning ‘Invincible’ season in 2004, the Gunners have struggled to really compete at the top of the table but look to have finally turned the page on a difficult chapter for the club.

Liverpool’s quadruple dream comes to an end in FA Cup quarterfinal thriller against Manchester United
Under Arteta, Arsenal looks rejuvenated and has continued to prove itself amid plenty of doubters this season.
The North London club seemingly threw away the league title last season, letting slip a healthy lead at the top of the table as Manchester City cruised past them.
This year, though, Arteta hopes it will be a different story.
“I can’t really remember how I was feeling last year. I was very excited, we kept growing, we tried our best and in the end we didn’t do enough to win it,” he said after beating Luton.
“Sometimes you just have to recognise the consistency and quality of other teams like we did and try again and go again, and here we are.”
For Liverpool, meanwhile, there is a sense that this season’s title race is all about one man, Jürgen Klopp.
The German has simply revolutionised the club and his decision to leave Liverpool at the end of the season came as a shock to the world of football.
The team now looks focused on winning a league title as the perfect way of saying thank you to Klopp after his years of service.
After going 1-0 up in the first half against Sheffield United – Klopp said Darwin Núñez’s opener was one of his “favourite goals ever” – Liverpool was pegged back by a Conor Bradley own goal.
Chasing a seemingly lost cause, Nunez had successfully charged down United goalkeeper Ivo Grbic’s clearance and the ball ended up in the back of the net.
And goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo ensured Liverpool remains the supercomputer’s favorite to lift the Premier League trophy.
“As a manager, you have to take it like you get it,” Klopp said after the win. “I would prefer to be 5-0 up at that moment [when Sheffield United equalized] already but that’s tricky.
“Then obviously we controlled the game but there are different ways to control a football game and the way we controlled it today was not the right one with not enough creating.
“What you have to do, we saw that after 60 minutes, you have to accelerate, you have to speed up, you have to overlap, underlap – and that’s what we did all of a sudden.”
Is this the most exciting EPL title race ever?
With Manchester City dominating the league title in recent seasons – it’s won in four of the last five years – only Liverpool has really been able to truly challenge Guardiola’s history makers of late.
But this year is a different prospect, with there being a legitimate three-way title race for the first time in a very long while.
The last time three teams were truly pitted against each other at the summit of the league was in 2014, where Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool all stood a chance going into the final two fixtures of the season.
City eventually pipped its rivals to the title, with Liverpool two points behind in second and Chelsea another two points behind in third.
With neither side looking like dropping their form, the neutral will be hoping this year will also go down to the wire.

Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun was paid $32.8 million in 2023
Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun was awarded a giant stock bonus on top of his more-than-a-million-dollar salary last year, despite overseeing a company that has been plagued by chronic losses and safety problems.
Calhoun’s total compensation in 2023 was $32.8 million, a 45% increase from the $22.6 million he received for 2022. And it could have been a lot more: He declined to accept his annual incentive bonus of $2,800,000 – a request the board said he made after part of a Boeing 737 Max plane blew off the side of an Alaska Airlines flight in January, kicking off a series of federal investigations, a temporary grounding, executive ousters and another embarrassing public relations blunder for the company.
Boeing enjoyed improved financial results in 2023 from Calhoun’s first two years running the troubled aircraft manufacturer. It continued to lose money as it has every year since 2019, but it trimmed those losses by 60%, reporting a core operating loss of $1.8 billion. Its stock gained 37% during the year, and it had a record month for new commercial jet orders in December, giving it one of its best sales years ever, as airlines were eager for new jets to meet strong demand for travel.
But after the January 5 door plug blowout, causing a gaping hole in the side of the jet, Boeing’s reputation for safety and quality may have reached an all-time low. A preliminary investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board found that the plane had left a Boeing factory two months before the incident missing the four bolts needed to hold the door plug in place. Calhoun told investors in January that “we caused the problem, and we understand that. Whatever conclusions are reached, Boeing is accountable for what happened.”
Last month, Calhoun announced he would be retiring later this year and that the company had launched a search for a new CEO. Calhoun turns 67 later this month, and Boeing’s board had actually moved back the retirement age for CEOs by five years to keep him in place.
Upon his retirement, Calhoun is set to take home a giant going-away present: a $45 million mix of stock awards and options that vest over time. That’s on top of whatever salary and bonus he may earn this year – although it wouldn’t be surprising if Boeing’s board vastly reduces his 2024 pay, and perhaps his retirement awards, because of the state he has left the company in as CEO.
Boeing did not respond to a request for comment.
Calhoun became CEO in January of 2020, in the midst of a 20-month grounding of the 737 Max that followed two fatal crashes that killed 346 people in late 2018 and early 2019. Almost immediately Boeing and the aviation industry was hit by a near halt in air travel caused by the pandemic, which caused demand for planes to come to a near halt. In April of that year Calhoun suspended his base pay. But stock and other compensation he had already received when taking the job brought his 2020 total compensation to $21.7 million. It climbed slowly steadily in the two subsequent years, bringing his total compensation to $64.6 million heading into 2023.
Correction: A previous version of this story misstated Calhoun's 2022 compensation. It was $22.6 million.

Trump Media stock sinks to post-merger low
Shares of Truth Social owner Trump Media & Technology Group tumbled 12% on Friday, sinking to their lowest level since the company went public last week.
The selloff has erased nearly $2 billion from the value of former President Donald Trump’s stake in the company this week.
Trump Media shared surged to as high as $79.38 on March 26, the day trading began on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol “DJT.”
Since then, the Truth Social owner’s share price has plunged by 49% to the closing price of $40.49 on Friday.
Trump Media’s shares have lost about a third of their value this week. Despite this week’s losses, Trump Media shares have still spiked by more than 130% so far this year.
Trump’s personal stake in the company is now valued at about $3.2 billion. That’s down from $4.9 billion at the end of last week.
Trump Media recently disclosed losing $58 million last year on very light revenue of just $4.1 million. The financial results underscore concerns raised by some experts that the company is being vastly overvalued by Wall Street.
Barry Diller, the billionaire chairman of Expedia and People Magazine owner IAC, told CNBC on Thursday that Trump Media is a “scam” and people buying the stock are “dopes.”
“I mean, it’s ridiculous,” Diller said on CNBC. “The company has no revenue.”
A Trump Media spokesperson denounced critics of the company.
“It is unsurprising to see die-hard Trump haters and leftwing flacks blow a gasket now that Truth Social has become a public company that, still today, refuses to suppress political expression that contradicts the narratives they want to enforce,” Shannon Devine, a Trump Media spokesperson, said in a statement to CNN

Share of women in C-suite roles falls for first time in two decades, study finds
For the first time in nearly two decades, the percentage of women in the C-suite at publicly traded US companies has dropped.
And growth in the percentage of women in senior corporate leadership roles overall barely budged from 2022 to 2023.
That’s according to a new report from S&P Global Market Intelligence, which studied gender parity data in regulatory documents and press releases for companies on the S&P Global Total Market Index.
“The growth in women’s representation among senior corporate positions, once a bright spot for gender parity, potentially faces an alarming turning point. Exponential growth over a decade is showing signs of losing momentum,” the S&P researchers wrote.
In 2023, women held just 11.8% of the roughly 15,000 C-suite roles assessed, down from 12.2% the year before, the study found. That’s the first time women have lost seats since 2005, the year S&P started measuring the data.
Meanwhile, the year-over-year growth rate in women’s representation in senior corporate roles overall was just 0.5%, the lowest rate recorded in more than a decade and well below the 1.2% average.
One possible contributing factor, the study suggests, is a waning focus on diversity and equity efforts. In analyzing what was said on earnings calls, researchers found “publicly traded firms are spending less time on diversity and inclusion.”
The peak of DEI mentions came in 2020 during the Covid pandemic. But the mentions of “diversity” and “inclusion” in 2023 fell to the lowest levels since 2012.
Gender parity goal imperiled
None of this is to say that there hasn’t been real progress in narrowing the gender gap since 2005.
“Across all [senior] roles, women held less than 8% of seats as recently as 2005; versus 22.3% in 2023. Representation among the highly coveted C-suite positions has been harder to gain, jumping only from 6.5% to 11.8% over the same period,” S&P’s study noted.
But given that women have been joining the workforce in droves for at least half a century, their share of top roles is still low.
If the growth rate remains below average going forward, the goal of reaching gender parity will be much farther out of reach. S&P estimates that forecasts for parity in senior roles could be pushed back by up to seven years to as late as 2042 relative to estimates from last year.
Making sure parity is reached sooner rather than later will require a concerted effort, the researchers suggest. “The 2023 figures show a decline in the growth rate of women’s representation across all senior roles and an unprecedented (over the study period) loss of seats in the highly coveted C-Suite. Such metrics should be monitored and considered, to ensure progress toward established goals.”

ESPN executive Norby Williamson, who came under attack in recent months from host Pat McAfee in an on-air rant accusing the network veteran of “sabotage,” will depart the sports network.
The move was announced Friday in a memo to staff from ESPN president of content Burke Magnus.
“I am reaching out with some important news. Norby Williamson will be leaving the company today after nearly 40 years of dedicated service,” Magnus wrote in the memo.
“During Norby’s career, he made significant contributions across many important roles within Content,” Magnus continued. “Through his steadfast commitment and attention to detail, Norby has had a lasting impact on the sports fans’ experience. His wide-ranging influence includes SportsCenter, breaking news coverage, immense creativity within event and studio productions and diverse storytelling across various ESPN platforms.”
Magnus said the network would conduct a search for a new senior content executive. He did not state a reason for Williamson’s departure.
Earlier this year, McAfee, who hosts his show on ESPN and YouTube, described Williamson as a “rat” and accused him of leaking false information about the show to media.
“There are some people actively trying to sabotage us from within ESPN,” McAfee said on his program. “More specifically I believe Norby Williamson is the guy who is attempting to sabotage our program.”
The public attack on a senior network executive stunned observers. McAfee, who did not face discipline for the comments, later addressed the remarks on the air, doubling down on his beef with Williamson.
“Now there’s certainly people that we don’t like and they don’t like us,” McAfee said, without naming anyone in particular. “That’s how it’s going to be and I don’t take back anything I said about ‘said person,’ but the overall storyline about us and ESPN … is that we’re strong, baby.”
The comments came after McAfee ignited fierce backlash for allowing New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers, a paid contributor on the program, to suggest on the air that ABC late night star Jimmy Kimmel could be linked to Jeffrey Epstein, who died by suicide in jail while awaiting federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019.
Kimmel vigorously denied the allegation and suggested he might sue Rodgers for the false claim.
In a note to staff Friday, Williamson celebrated his work at the network, where he first started as an employee in the company’s mailroom.
“Almost 40 years ago in 1985, I was so very fortunate to be offered an opportunity at ESPN,” he wrote. “Due to the exceptional hard work, creativity and commitment of the people of ESPN, and to a much lesser extent my contributions, I’d like to think we’ve left our great company in a far better place than we found it.”

After a dismal year, Samsung forecasts a 900% jump in profit
Samsung Electronics has said it expects to report a huge rise in its operating profit in the first quarter, offering hopes of a strong recovery after a dismal 2023.
The South Korean tech giant estimates its operating profit to have increased to 6.6 trillion Korean won ($4.9 billion) in the January-to-March quarter, from the 0.64 trillion won reported a year earlier, according to an earnings guidance released on Friday. The forecast is higher than consensus estimates of 5.4 trillion won from FactSet.
Sales are expected to have risen by more than 11% to 71 trillion won, the world’s biggest memory chip maker added. It did not provide any additional details.
The company is expected to post its detailed earnings results later this month.
The upbeat forecast comes after Samsung reported four straight quarters of declining profits, as demand for consumer devices and the chips that power them remained sluggish last year.
But the company is optimistic about this year and said in January that it expects a resurgence in demand for mobile devices, particularly with the rollout of new products such as AI-powered smartphones.
The company also expects its chip business to recover this year “despite various potential obstacles, including interest rate policies and geopolitical issues,” it had said.

Nigeria wants a road to rival the Pacific Coast highway. A prime Lagos beach resort stands in the way
When Lagos state authorities notified Nigerian business mogul Paul Onwuanibe in late March that he had seven days to leave his multimillion-dollar beach resort so it could be torn down, he thought it was an April Fools’ Day hoax come early.
Onwuanibe, 58, was told in a government letter that his Landmark Beach resort – a top-tier destination visited, he says, by about a million local and foreign visitors last year – had to be removed as it “falls within the right of way” of a planned 700-kilometer (435-mile) coastal highway designed to link the former capital city to Calabar, a port city near the border with Cameroon.
Onwuanibe told CNN he had obtained the land in 2007 before the plans for the coastal highway were drawn up, and felt a mix of emotions after receiving the demolition order, which also urged him to file compensation claims.
“One was amazement, second was concern and the third one was, ‘is this real or is this an April Fools’ (Day prank in) advance?’”
Onwuanibe leads Landmark Group, a real estate developer and a key player in Nigeria’s tourism and hospitality industries.
The group’s leisure beach, listed among Nigeria’s best seven beaches in 2023 by the Lonely Planet travel guide, is a lucrative part of the 13-hectare mixed-use Landmark site along the Atlantic Ocean beachfront in Lagos’s affluent Victoria Island area.
The beach resort and other sections of the Landmark site on the coastal right of way are billed to be pulled down, a government notice seen by CNN states.

Valued at over $200 million, according to Onwuanibe, the Landmark site is home to over 80 businesses and provides more than 4,000 direct jobs. It also generates over 2 billion naira ($1.5 million) in annual tax revenue, the company said.
Approval for the new coastal road was given on February 27 by the federal authorities, according to presidential aide Temitope Ajayi. He said on X that the superhighway, “when completed, will enter the world record books among iconic coastal routes like the Wild Atlantic Highway in Ireland and the Pacific Coastal Highway in the United States.”
The first part of the 1.06 trillion naira ($841 million-plus) highway will be built in Victoria Island. The superhighway will run through a total of nine coastal states in Nigeria, Ajayi added, and will have “five lanes on each side of the dual carriageway and a train track in the middle,” as well as spurs linking up with northern Nigeria.
Environmentalists say that, while the coastal road project would bolster the economy, it also poses environmental problems.
“It’s undeniable that the road construction will bring about significant impacts such as the destruction of wetlands, forests, and various habitats,” said Lagos-based water and environment consultant Similade Adeodun. “Activities like sand filling and dredging along the coastal areas also raise concerns,” he told CNN.
CNN has contacted the Lagos State Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development for comment on the coastal right of way and the consultation process involved.
A blessing and a curse
Born in the United Kingdom, Onwuanibe says he “shut down” his investments abroad in 2007 to focus on ventures in Africa due to the continent’s economic prospects.
He commended the planned coastal project for “connecting vital regions of the country” but feared it came at a steep cost for tourism in Lagos and posed a threat to foreign direct investment into the country if Landmark Beach is eventually torn down.
“People who bring in money to make cities like this effective will be very concerned (with the proposed demolition of the beach resort). It will pose a huge threat to inward investment into the state and, most importantly, pose a threat to people who are already in the state trying to do things,” Onwuanibe said.
He told CNN the demolition of the beach would be an enormous loss, with millions of dollars of borrowed money already spent on developing the resort.
“We’ve spent between $80 and $90 million developing this ecosystem and one-third of that was spent on the beach. So, all that, which we are still paying loans on, will disappear,” he said.
Onwuanibe said foreign and local investors in Landmark Group were now threatening to pull out if the beach resort, which includes a mini golf course, a beach soccer field as well as a volleyball and basketball court, is removed.
“Without the beach, the entire ecosystem is at risk and is severely damaged,” he said, adding: “I have had widespread panic calls from my international and local investors as well as local debt providers threatening to pull the plug as they think this is material to our survival as a business.”
Lagos state, Nigeria’s economic nerve center, has been on the hunt for foreign investment as federal authorities battle to revamp the country’s economy in the face of challenges such as growing public and private debt, high inflation, and a sharp decline in the local currency.
However, “policy and regulatory inconsistency” and “poor stakeholders’ consultation” have limited foreign investment into Nigeria, according to a local think-tank, the Nigerian Economic Summit Group.
What can be done?
Environment consultant Adeodun is urging authorities to conduct thorough environmental and social impact assessments before tearing down coastal businesses for the superhighway.
“For Landmark Beach, which already generates significant revenue from eco-tourism, the government should explore robust measures to preserve the beach or consider alternative routes with fewer economic and ecological consequences,” Adeodun told CNN.

“I understand that the original right of way for the road did not pass through Landmark Beach… Perhaps, revisiting the routes to ensure minimal environmental damage and preserve local businesses should be strongly considered,” he added.
For Onwuanibe, the coastal highway, once rethought, should serve as a blessing for thriving businesses situated along the coast rather than a curse.
“The first thing would be to do a proper study and proper consultation with the businesses that are most affected along it. It’s a long-term project, so it requires more in-depth analysis,” he said, adding that he was hopeful that discussions with the government can produce a “win-win solution.”
“The second thing is to make sure that this (highway) is an advantage to those businesses and homes and all that socioeconomic activity, rather than a disadvantage,” he added.

Janet Yellen tackles China over flood of cheap goods
Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
Janet Yellen has kicked off her second visit to China as US treasury secretary with a warning of the risk to jobs and businesses posed by overproduction of certain goods in the world’s second largest economy.
On Friday, her first full day of meetings in the southern megacity of Guangzhou, Yellen said she would address the oversupply of Chinese goods in key industries, such as electric vehicles (EVs) and solar panels.
The issue has quickly emerged as a major area of contention globally and in the run-up to November’s US presidential election.
“Overcapacity isn’t a new problem, but it has intensified, and we’re seeing emerging risks in new sectors,” Yellen told a group of China-based American executives. “This can undercut the business of American firms and workers, as well as of firms around the world, including in India and Mexico.”
She first mentioned the issue at an earlier meeting with the leaders of Guangdong province, the country’s economic powerhouse.
US officials and lawmakers have expressed concern that China’s overinvestment and excess capacity could result in cheap products flooding global markets, affecting local industries and employment.
Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether she would consider trade barriers if China doesn’t heed warnings on overcapacity, Yellen said she “wouldn’t want to rule [it] out,” though she wasn’t planning any immediate measures.
Last month, on a visit to a solar panel factory in Georgia, Yellen said China’s excess capacity was distorting prices and production patterns and hurting American firms and workers. She added that China was following its old practice of flooding the global markets with cheap, state-subsidized steel and aluminum.

She also hinted on that trip that the surge in China’s exports of EVs, solar panels, and batteries was creating a problem at a time when the United States has invested heavily in reviving its own manufacturing sector.
For its part, Beijing is aware of the country’s overcapacity problem, having acknowledged it as a key challenge at an annual economic work conference in December.
But last month, several Chinese state-owned media outlets published editorials challenging the notion that China’s supply glut poses a threat to other economies. “What China exports is advanced production capacity that meets the needs of foreign customers,” the Xinhua news agency wrote.
Invoking a reformer
At the meeting hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce, Yellen flagged concerns about what she called China’s “shift away from a market approach on the US and global economy” by providing state subsidies to some manufacturing industries.
She referred to her host city of Guangzhou to make a point about the importance of pragmatism and openness by invoking Deng Xiaoping, the late reformist leader who led China away from a planned economy and Maoist ideologies.
“It was a key stop on Deng Xiaoping’s 1992 Southern Tour, when he renewed China’s commitment to these [market-oriented] reforms,” she said. “It’s a fitting place for me to emphasize the strong economic ties between the United States and China, and the benefits these ties can bring for both the US and Chinese economies.”

The tour marked a critical point in modern Chinese history. That year, Deng, then 88, made a surprise visit to the special economic zones in Guangdong that he had established previously and confirmed China’s commitment to market-oriented reforms and economic liberalization.
The tour, which happened during a period of political uncertainty, is widely considered to have revived the process of China’s reform and opening up, which had almost stalled after 1989.
Yellen is scheduled to spend four days in Guangzhou and Beijing and is expected to meet Chinese Premier Li Qiang, former Vice Premier Liu He, People’s Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng and Finance Minister Lan Fo’an.
On Friday afternoon, Yellen met with Vice Premier He Lifeng during which she emphasised the importance of a “level-playing field” for companies and workers in both countries.
Following the meeting, He will host a dinner for Yellen.
Craig Singleton, senior director of the China program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), a non-partisan think tank in Washington, said tangible outcomes from the trip may be “limited.”
“For now, China’s primary focus remains portraying itself as open for business and alleviating growing concerns about the government’s to-date meager measures to tackle the country’s looming economic downturn,” he said.
Yellen told reporters traveling with her to China that the meetings should be seen as a “continuation of a dialogue” between the US and China since Biden and Xi’s November 2022 meeting at the G20 in Bali.
Trade tensions
Biden administration officials have suggested raising tariffs on Chinese imports to “level” the playing field for trade. As the US approaches the presidential race, candidates from both parties are trying to look tough on Beijing. Former President Donald Trump has threatened to slap 60% tariffs on imports from China if he is re-elected.
Trade tensions are rising as Chinese leaders increasingly utilize a strategy of boosting manufacturing for export to make up for weak demand at home amid loss of economic momentum.
Beijing has poured money into new industries such as EVs and batteries as it seeks alternative growth engines beyond the property sector, a major pillar of the Chinese economy, which has crumbled.
“China accounts for a third of global production but only a sixth of global consumption, and this reality risks breaking the global trading system,” said Rick Waters, managing director of Eurasia Group’s China practice.
“Xi’s emphasis on ‘new productive forces’ as the future driver of growth will only make matters worse in the absence of measures that boost domestic consumption.”
Xi coined the term ”new productive forces” last year, highlighting the need for a new model for economic growth based on tech innovation. The “forces” are often referred to as emerging industries such as EVs, new materials and artificial intelligence.
Conflict over trade is likely to grow further before the election, Waters said. He said the Section 301 investigation — which allows the US government to impose tariffs, fees or other restrictions to address unfair trade policies by foreign governments — and the likely realignment of Trump-era tariffs to increase barriers to EV and other imports are all on the table.
Among other topics that Yellen plans to discuss with her Chinese counterparts include bilateral cooperation on countering illicit finance and working on global issues such as climate change and financial stability, according to the Treasury Department.
But analysts don’t think Beijing is likely to budge on its economic policies.
“Yellen’s upcoming meetings merely extend the illusion of constructive engagement between two superpowers — reinforcing, rather than resolving, China’s contentious course,” Singleton said.
He believes Beijing wants to reduce the role of US multinationals in supply chains deemed sensitive by the Chinese government, while deepening its control over China’s private sector and international companies operating in China, noting recently enacted national security legislation in Hong Kong.

A double dose of hell: The Bataan Death March and what came next
On the grounds of an elementary school in a small Philippine town, the fuse was lit on one of the worst war crimes of the 20th century while at the same time setting in motion one of the greatest survival stories in US military history.
The main feature of the Bataan World War II Museum behind Balanga Elementary School is a life-size diorama of the surrender of the US forces in the Philippines to Japanese commanders on April 9, 1942.
The museum itself is tiny, taking up less than two floors of a building that doesn’t seem much bigger than a modern American suburban house. There are some displays of the weapons of the Bataan campaign, bits of a wreckage, a few personal items, wall art with bullet points of World War II and the fighting in the Philippines. The diorama sits outside its entrance.
It hardly seems enough to remember what it represents – the largest surrender of US military forces in history.
Hours after that surrender, tens of thousands of Filipino and American troops began the Bataan Death March, a five-day, 65-mile trek to a prison camp to the north, during which they were denied food and water amid searing heat.
Thousands would die. Others would show unimaginable resilience.
The Battle of Bataan
As Japanese planes were bombing Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, Tokyo’s forces were also making their first attacks on other US military positions in the Pacific. And the Philippines was a key target.
Then a US commonwealth, the Philippines was home to some 20,000 US troops. About 100,000 Filipinos were also attached to the US Army by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1941 and the combined force was known as the US Army in the Far East (USAFFE).
Two weeks after its first aerial attacks on December 8, 1941, Japan’s main invasion force landed on the main Philippine island of Luzon, and in just over three months pushed the US and Filipino defenders into the Bataan Peninsula, across Manila Bay from the Philippine capital.
The plan of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the US commander in the Philippines, had been for his forces to hold out on the southern part of the peninsula until the US Navy could deliver reinforcements and supplies to the besieged defenders.
But the Americans and Filipinos quickly ran out of ammunition, medicine and food, and the commander on Bataan, Gen. Edward King, went against his superior’s orders and told his troops to lay down their arms, accepting personal responsibility for the defeat.
“You men remember this. You did not surrender … you had no alternative but to obey my order,” he said.
Accounts from the time said King asked for assurances from the Japanese officer accepting the surrender, Col. Matoo Nakayama, that his troops be treated humanely.
“We are not barbarians” was the Japanese reply.
A post-war trial would find the Japanese commander in the Battle of Bataan and the man responsible for the troops that carried out the Death March, Gen. Masaharu Homma, guilty of war crimes. He was executed in 1946.
The Death March
That surrender site in Balanga doesn’t mark the beginning of the Bataan Death March. Some of the troops came from Marileves on the peninsula’s southern tip and Bagac on the west coast. But all would pass Balanga as they moved north.
The march’s route now looks like a roadway you could see many places in the world. Trucks and cars share the pavement with the ubiquitous motorized tricycles and jeepneys that provide public transport in the Philippines.
It passes McDonald’s and Jollibee restaurants, strip malls and car dealerships, farm fields and under-construction housing developments touting the latest in luxury living at affordable prices.
But in 1942, it was hell on Earth.
The American and Filipino POWs were put in groups of 100 men each, with four Japanese guards per group, according to a US Army history. They marched four abreast in “blistering” heat.
Survivor James Bollich recounted the suffering in a 2012 interview with the Air Force News Service.
“They beat us with rifle butts, sabers, clubs, anything they could get their hands on. That went on all day long. They wouldn’t let anybody have a drink of water or let us rest, and they didn’t feed us,” Bollich said.
“Once anybody collapsed, the Japanese immediately killed them,” he said. “It looked like they were really trying to kill us all.”
Today the route is marked by occasional white concrete markers by the roadside, some remembering those who were on it, like one at kilometer 24, dedicated to the memories of “J.B. McBrid (sic) and Tillman R. Rutledge, two buddies who walked the Bataan Death March.”
A marker for kilometer 100, in front of the veterans cemetery on the former US Clark Air Base, just says “Death March.”
Death in boxcar
For the thousands of US and Filipino POWs, the trek from Bataan to the detention facility at the former US military Camp O’Donnell in Capas, to the north of the peninsula, was not entirely on foot.
From a railhead in San Fernando to another about five miles from the prison camp, the POWs were jammed into boxcars for about 30 miles (48 kilometers) of their journey.
The smallest of these boxcars were about 240 square feet (22 square meters) on the interior. With wooden sides, metal roofs and only a small slit for ventilation, they became ovens for the 100 or more POWs in each.
The last of their kind sits today on the Capas National Shrine, erected on the site of the former Camp O’Donnell, but a visitor could easily miss it.
It’s displayed off the parking area of the sprawling monument to the Philippines war dead. Unlike in 1942, a roof shields the boxcar. It’s almost a sanctuary from the burning sun on a March 2024 morning.
But on a nearby plaque are the accounts of those who survived a box car – maybe this very one – in 1942, and it’s spooky to be near it, to poke your head through its open door and imagine the horror it once held.
“We were herded into crowded boxcars like cattle getting ready for slaughterhouse… Men were fighting and struggling to keep a foothold and stand upright… The platform (of the boxcar) was a sea of filth from dysentery patients.”
And more.
“We were being cooked alive in a 110-degree oven; we sweated, sizzled, urinated, defecated… I saw a few who were fainting but had not an inch to fall on… I do not know how many of my comrades died in that car, there must have been at least 10.”
But for those POWs who lived, there would be unthinkable ordeals yet to come.
The Capas Concentration Camp
Standing on the grounds of the former Camp O’Donnell today, it’s impossible to imagine what it once was, a prisoner of war detention facility with conditions so bad Filipinos refer to it today as the Capas Concentration Camp.
More than 31,000 trees – each numbered in white numerals – have been planted on the 133-acre site to honor each of the fallen during the Death March. A 230-foot-high (70-meter) obelisk towers over stone walls with the names of the dead engraved on them.
It’s peaceful on this March morning, a lone visitor outnumbered by the two-person snack and souvenir stand staff.
In the late spring and early summer of 1942, more than 60,000 survivors of the death march were jammed onto the same real estate, according to a US Army history.
“There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care and only slit trenches along the sides of the camp for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoners’ food,” the Army history says.
Around 400 POWs – Filipinos and Americans – would die each day, it says.According to the US Navy’s History and Heritage Command, about 9,000 Americans made it to O’Donnell, and 17% of those died there.
The toll was far worse for the Filipinos. Some 26,000 died at Camp O’Donnell during its 73 days of operations, according to the US Defense Department’s POW/MIA Accounting Agency.
Off to the left of the main Filipino memorial at Capas, across the parking lot and tucked up against the site’s perimeter, is a memorial bearing names of the American victims of O’Donnell. Hundreds of them are etched in stone, now weathered by the heat and humidity of this part of Luzon island.
Like the museum back at the surrender site in Balanga, it hardly seems enough to the memories of those who had suffered so much.
By midsummer 1942, the Japanese decided to close O’Donnell.
Over the next six months, Filipino POWs were gradually released back into the local population, after signing pledges not to take up arms against Japanese occupiers.
The Americans at O’Donnell were moved to another camp, Cabanatuan, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) to the west, where conditions were marginally better.
But by 1944, the resolve of American POWs would be tested again.
Thousands more of them would die. But a few would pull off one of the greatest but largely unheralded survival stories of World War II.
America’s worst maritime tragedy
There’s no memorial in the Philippines to the single biggest loss of life at sea in US history. But the grounds of the Capas monument are a good place to think about it because its roots run through there and back down to that surrender site in Balanga.
By 1944, Japan needed laborers to sustain its war effort in factories and mines and POWs were an easy source of manpower. And US forces island-hopping across the Pacific were closing in on the Philippines, looking to make good on Gen. MacArthur’s pledge of “I shall return.”
So the American POWs at Cabanatuan and other camps were loaded into the holds of cargo ships to be taken to Japan or its occupied territories.
Conditions for prisoners on the ships were much like those boxcars on the death march, men packed so tightly there was no room to sit in darkened holds with no ventilation and temperatures well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).
The Americans called them “hell ships.”
On October 24, 1944, one of those hell ships, the Arisan Maru, was steaming in the Bashi Strait between the Philippines and Taiwan with more than 1,700 American POWs in its holds when a US Navy submarine, mistaking the unmarked ship for a Japanese cargo or troop transport, struck it with a torpedo.
The old freighter broke apart and the POWs spilled into the South China Sea, according to accounts from some of the nine Americans who survived.
Four were picked up and taken back into custody by Japanese forces.
But five US soldiers, Lt. Robert Overbeck, Sgt. Calvin Graef, Pvt. Avery Wilber, Cpl. Donald Meyer and Pvt. Anton Cichy,  would escape to freedom.
All but Meyer also survived the Bataan Death March.
According to their accounts, they were led by Overbeck, who like almost all of the POWs, was forced away from Japanese naval ships that could have rescued them.
But the lieutenant was lucky enough to find an Arisan Maru lifeboat left to float away after the Japanese crew that used it boarded a rescue ship. They’d also left a small amount of food and fresh water aboard.
Overbeck’s luck continued when the lifeboat bumped into a wooden crate that contained a sail.
Eventually, four other POWs would join Overbeck aboard that lifeboat. And as the Army lieutenant, a civilian mining engineer in the Philippines when war broke out, had a bit of sailing experience, he was able to pilot the lifeboat about 250 miles toward the Chinese coast, on at least one occasion avoiding a Japanese warship in the South China Sea.
According to Overbeck’s account, posted online by his son Charles, they were taken aboard a local junk boat near the Chinese coast and from there were escorted inland, avoiding the Japanese occupiers.

“For 12 days the five survivors were transported about 600 miles by foot, truck, bicycle and plane to Kunming airfield, base of the 14th Air Force and the former Flying Tigers,” according to a 2019 synopsis of the Arisan Maru sinking from the nonprofit research project Asia Policy Point.
The five survivors would fly west from Kunming aboard a US C-47 on November 28, 1944.
“We arrived in Washington, D. C. on December 1, 1944, via North Africa and the Atlantic,” Overbeck wrote.
“But it was mid-February before word was received from the Japanese through the Red Cross in Geneva that our ship had been sunk with no POW survivors. I saw the list with our names along with the rest – close friends, acquaintances, enemies and strangers.”
According to a US Naval History and Heritage Command webpage, 1,781 POWs, almost all American, were aboard Arisan Maru when it left the Philippines.
“This was the greatest US loss of life at sea,” it says.

A double dose of hell: The Bataan Death March and what came next
On the grounds of an elementary school in a small Philippine town, the fuse was lit on one of the worst war crimes of the 20th century while at the same time setting in motion one of the greatest survival stories in US military history.
The main feature of the Bataan World War II Museum behind Balanga Elementary School is a life-size diorama of the surrender of the US forces in the Philippines to Japanese commanders on April 9, 1942.
The museum itself is tiny, taking up less than two floors of a building that doesn’t seem much bigger than a modern American suburban house. There are some displays of the weapons of the Bataan campaign, bits of a wreckage, a few personal items, wall art with bullet points of World War II and the fighting in the Philippines. The diorama sits outside its entrance.
It hardly seems enough to remember what it represents – the largest surrender of US military forces in history.
Hours after that surrender, tens of thousands of Filipino and American troops began the Bataan Death March, a five-day, 65-mile trek to a prison camp to the north, during which they were denied food and water amid searing heat.
Thousands would die. Others would show unimaginable resilience.
The Battle of Bataan
As Japanese planes were bombing Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, Tokyo’s forces were also making their first attacks on other US military positions in the Pacific. And the Philippines was a key target.
Then a US commonwealth, the Philippines was home to some 20,000 US troops. About 100,000 Filipinos were also attached to the US Army by President Franklin Roosevelt in 1941 and the combined force was known as the US Army in the Far East (USAFFE).
Two weeks after its first aerial attacks on December 8, 1941, Japan’s main invasion force landed on the main Philippine island of Luzon, and in just over three months pushed the US and Filipino defenders into the Bataan Peninsula, across Manila Bay from the Philippine capital.
The plan of Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the US commander in the Philippines, had been for his forces to hold out on the southern part of the peninsula until the US Navy could deliver reinforcements and supplies to the besieged defenders.
But the Americans and Filipinos quickly ran out of ammunition, medicine and food, and the commander on Bataan, Gen. Edward King, went against his superior’s orders and told his troops to lay down their arms, accepting personal responsibility for the defeat.
“You men remember this. You did not surrender … you had no alternative but to obey my order,” he said.
Accounts from the time said King asked for assurances from the Japanese officer accepting the surrender, Col. Matoo Nakayama, that his troops be treated humanely.
“We are not barbarians” was the Japanese reply.
A post-war trial would find the Japanese commander in the Battle of Bataan and the man responsible for the troops that carried out the Death March, Gen. Masaharu Homma, guilty of war crimes. He was executed in 1946.
The Death March
That surrender site in Balanga doesn’t mark the beginning of the Bataan Death March. Some of the troops came from Marileves on the peninsula’s southern tip and Bagac on the west coast. But all would pass Balanga as they moved north.
The march’s route now looks like a roadway you could see many places in the world. Trucks and cars share the pavement with the ubiquitous motorized tricycles and jeepneys that provide public transport in the Philippines.
It passes McDonald’s and Jollibee restaurants, strip malls and car dealerships, farm fields and under-construction housing developments touting the latest in luxury living at affordable prices.
But in 1942, it was hell on Earth.
The American and Filipino POWs were put in groups of 100 men each, with four Japanese guards per group, according to a US Army history. They marched four abreast in “blistering” heat.
Survivor James Bollich recounted the suffering in a 2012 interview with the Air Force News Service.
“They beat us with rifle butts, sabers, clubs, anything they could get their hands on. That went on all day long. They wouldn’t let anybody have a drink of water or let us rest, and they didn’t feed us,” Bollich said.
“Once anybody collapsed, the Japanese immediately killed them,” he said. “It looked like they were really trying to kill us all.”
Today the route is marked by occasional white concrete markers by the roadside, some remembering those who were on it, like one at kilometer 24, dedicated to the memories of “J.B. McBrid (sic) and Tillman R. Rutledge, two buddies who walked the Bataan Death March.”
A marker for kilometer 100, in front of the veterans cemetery on the former US Clark Air Base, just says “Death March.”
Death in boxcar
For the thousands of US and Filipino POWs, the trek from Bataan to the detention facility at the former US military Camp O’Donnell in Capas, to the north of the peninsula, was not entirely on foot.
From a railhead in San Fernando to another about five miles from the prison camp, the POWs were jammed into boxcars for about 30 miles (48 kilometers) of their journey.
The smallest of these boxcars were about 240 square feet (22 square meters) on the interior. With wooden sides, metal roofs and only a small slit for ventilation, they became ovens for the 100 or more POWs in each.
The last of their kind sits today on the Capas National Shrine, erected on the site of the former Camp O’Donnell, but a visitor could easily miss it.
It’s displayed off the parking area of the sprawling monument to the Philippines war dead. Unlike in 1942, a roof shields the boxcar. It’s almost a sanctuary from the burning sun on a March 2024 morning.
But on a nearby plaque are the accounts of those who survived a box car – maybe this very one – in 1942, and it’s spooky to be near it, to poke your head through its open door and imagine the horror it once held.
“We were herded into crowded boxcars like cattle getting ready for slaughterhouse… Men were fighting and struggling to keep a foothold and stand upright… The platform (of the boxcar) was a sea of filth from dysentery patients.”
And more.
“We were being cooked alive in a 110-degree oven; we sweated, sizzled, urinated, defecated… I saw a few who were fainting but had not an inch to fall on… I do not know how many of my comrades died in that car, there must have been at least 10.”
But for those POWs who lived, there would be unthinkable ordeals yet to come.
The Capas Concentration Camp
Standing on the grounds of the former Camp O’Donnell today, it’s impossible to imagine what it once was, a prisoner of war detention facility with conditions so bad Filipinos refer to it today as the Capas Concentration Camp.
More than 31,000 trees – each numbered in white numerals – have been planted on the 133-acre site to honor each of the fallen during the Death March. A 230-foot-high (70-meter) obelisk towers over stone walls with the names of the dead engraved on them.
It’s peaceful on this March morning, a lone visitor outnumbered by the two-person snack and souvenir stand staff.
In the late spring and early summer of 1942, more than 60,000 survivors of the death march were jammed onto the same real estate, according to a US Army history.
“There was little running water, sparse food, no medical care and only slit trenches along the sides of the camp for sanitation. The heat was intolerable, flies rose out of the latrines and covered the prisoners’ food,” the Army history says.
Around 400 POWs – Filipinos and Americans – would die each day, it says.According to the US Navy’s History and Heritage Command, about 9,000 Americans made it to O’Donnell, and 17% of those died there.
The toll was far worse for the Filipinos. Some 26,000 died at Camp O’Donnell during its 73 days of operations, according to the US Defense Department’s POW/MIA Accounting Agency.
Off to the left of the main Filipino memorial at Capas, across the parking lot and tucked up against the site’s perimeter, is a memorial bearing names of the American victims of O’Donnell. Hundreds of them are etched in stone, now weathered by the heat and humidity of this part of Luzon island.
Like the museum back at the surrender site in Balanga, it hardly seems enough to the memories of those who had suffered so much.
By midsummer 1942, the Japanese decided to close O’Donnell.
Over the next six months, Filipino POWs were gradually released back into the local population, after signing pledges not to take up arms against Japanese occupiers.
The Americans at O’Donnell were moved to another camp, Cabanatuan, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) to the west, where conditions were marginally better.
But by 1944, the resolve of American POWs would be tested again.
Thousands more of them would die. But a few would pull off one of the greatest but largely unheralded survival stories of World War II.
America’s worst maritime tragedy
There’s no memorial in the Philippines to the single biggest loss of life at sea in US history. But the grounds of the Capas monument are a good place to think about it because its roots run through there and back down to that surrender site in Balanga.
By 1944, Japan needed laborers to sustain its war effort in factories and mines and POWs were an easy source of manpower. And US forces island-hopping across the Pacific were closing in on the Philippines, looking to make good on Gen. MacArthur’s pledge of “I shall return.”
So the American POWs at Cabanatuan and other camps were loaded into the holds of cargo ships to be taken to Japan or its occupied territories.
Conditions for prisoners on the ships were much like those boxcars on the death march, men packed so tightly there was no room to sit in darkened holds with no ventilation and temperatures well above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Celsius).
The Americans called them “hell ships.”
On October 24, 1944, one of those hell ships, the Arisan Maru, was steaming in the Bashi Strait between the Philippines and Taiwan with more than 1,700 American POWs in its holds when a US Navy submarine, mistaking the unmarked ship for a Japanese cargo or troop transport, struck it with a torpedo.
The old freighter broke apart and the POWs spilled into the South China Sea, according to accounts from some of the nine Americans who survived.
Four were picked up and taken back into custody by Japanese forces.
But five US soldiers, Lt. Robert Overbeck, Sgt. Calvin Graef, Pvt. Avery Wilber, Cpl. Donald Meyer and Pvt. Anton Cichy,  would escape to freedom.
All but Meyer also survived the Bataan Death March.
According to their accounts, they were led by Overbeck, who like almost all of the POWs, was forced away from Japanese naval ships that could have rescued them.
But the lieutenant was lucky enough to find an Arisan Maru lifeboat left to float away after the Japanese crew that used it boarded a rescue ship. They’d also left a small amount of food and fresh water aboard.
Overbeck’s luck continued when the lifeboat bumped into a wooden crate that contained a sail.
Eventually, four other POWs would join Overbeck aboard that lifeboat. And as the Army lieutenant, a civilian mining engineer in the Philippines when war broke out, had a bit of sailing experience, he was able to pilot the lifeboat about 250 miles toward the Chinese coast, on at least one occasion avoiding a Japanese warship in the South China Sea.
According to Overbeck’s account, posted online by his son Charles, they were taken aboard a local junk boat near the Chinese coast and from there were escorted inland, avoiding the Japanese occupiers.

“For 12 days the five survivors were transported about 600 miles by foot, truck, bicycle and plane to Kunming airfield, base of the 14th Air Force and the former Flying Tigers,” according to a 2019 synopsis of the Arisan Maru sinking from the nonprofit research project Asia Policy Point.
The five survivors would fly west from Kunming aboard a US C-47 on November 28, 1944.
“We arrived in Washington, D. C. on December 1, 1944, via North Africa and the Atlantic,” Overbeck wrote.
“But it was mid-February before word was received from the Japanese through the Red Cross in Geneva that our ship had been sunk with no POW survivors. I saw the list with our names along with the rest – close friends, acquaintances, enemies and strangers.”

The incredible ‘sacred’ waterfall in Angola that you’ve probably never heard of
Kalandula Falls
Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.
“No one can say that God doesn’t exist when we see the wonders that God has done here.” That was Sebastião Gaspar Agostinho’s reaction as he visited Kalandula Falls for the first time.
Agostinho, accompanied by a group of women from his church, made an hours-long bus journey just to see the cascade, which is one of Africa’s largest waterfalls, and it was worth the drive.
“I have seen the Kalandula Falls on television,” he says. “I have seen pictures of the Kalandula Falls, but today, seeing it in person, the impact is different.”
The waterfalls, which lie almost 400 kilometers (240 miles) east of Angola’s capital Luanda, in Malanje Province, are traditionally believed to be sacred. Visitors basking in their immense power can understand why.
The experience begins at the parking lot near the falls. Even here, out of sight of the attraction, visitors can feel the energy generated by the massive amounts of water crashing onto the rocks below.
It’s approached by walking across an even field of large stones that leads to the top edge of the falls. From here it’s possible to get a true sense of the size and power of Kalandula Falls – the roaring waters span a width of 400 meters, with a drop of 100 meters.
Spiritual history
The spectacle is wreathed in a cool mist that locals say is part of its spiritual history.
“What the elders say is that in the past, the Kalandula Falls were a sacred place,” says Nelson Andre, the director of tourism and culture in Kalandula. “It’s a location where rituals were performed to calm the gods and ask for well-being, health and prosperity for society in general.”
Kalandula (sometimes written as Calandula) is only a fraction of the width of Victoria Falls, Africa’s largest waterfall with a width of more than 1,700 meters, but it is almost just as tall with a powerful and relentless flow of water.
“It is not possible for a man to do what happens in these Kalandula Falls,” says Nelson Andre. “Rain or shine, the water never dries up, there is always water. It is the place where God took with his hands and painted the Kalandula Falls.”

To get the full experience of the falls, visitors need to venture down a steep and rocky trail that takes them to the bottom. It takes about 30 minutes to make the hike along part of the Lucala River that feeds Kalandula.
Those who complete the trek are gifted with a picturesque sight that will wow their social media followers. They’ll find themselves almost surrounded by the horseshoe-shaped waterfall, which creates a thundering backdrop of cascading water.
On most days the view will also include a rainbow so vivid you may want to make sure a pot of gold isn’t nearby.
Hidden treasure
“Everybody that comes here like me feels the same feeling because what this landscape shows us is amazing,” says Pedro Francisco, a local guide who takes people down to the bottom of the falls every day.
“You can come here with your problems and when you come down here it all blows up. You forget all the problems you have.”
The Kalandula Falls are truly a hidden treasure in Angola. This is partly because they’re not heavily promoted as a tourist destination and also because of their location.
There’s only one major road that connects the area to Luanda and many parts of it are riddled with potholes or patches of damage – so it’s a long bumpy ride to get there.
Although there are currently no restaurants or shops near the falls, making them the area’s sole draw for visitors, local authorities want to change that.
“We need to have infrastructure here that will attract tourists and make them feel that they have what they need within the Kalandula Falls,” Nelson Andre says. “We believe that tourists are attracted not only by the divine wonder but also by the things that exist around it. Having good services will make tourism grow at the municipal level.”
Friendly welcome
There is one hotel – a very modest bed and breakfast but in an almost perfect location. It’s called Pousada Quedas de Kalandula and it sits by itself on a lush green plateau right by the cascading waters.
Guests who stay there can see the falls from their balconies and enjoy breakfast on the patio, which also provides an unobstructed view.  It also makes for awesome photo opportunities.
“It was first built in the 1950s, during the colonial era,” says Benvinda Ribeiro who manages the hotel.
She said the hotel has been revived after being shut down during the civil war that gripped Angola from 1975, after Portuguese colonial rule ended, to 2002. It reopened in 2017 after a three-year renovation.
Ribeiro says that 70% of her guests are foreigners.  She hopes more people from inside the country come for the experience.
“Those coming to visit these wonders will be well received,” she says.  “We want everyone to come, not only foreigners but also Angolans, they will always be well received in the same way, always with the same friendliness.”

The gigantic tunnels and bridges linking Asia to Europe
The bridges and tunnels that cross the Bosphorus and Dardanelles
Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.
With sloping banks studded with elegant private mansions, palace parks and centuries-old groves, the Bosphorus is the embodiment of Istanbul.
This 19-mile (30-kilometer) strait runs from the Black Sea in the north to the Sea of Marmara in the south.
The urban sprawl covers Europe in the west and Asia to the east, geographical facts giving rise to the romantically evocative but somewhat fanciful description of Istanbul as a city that straddles two continents.
Technically it does, but the Bosphorus isn’t the city’s only waterway. Just before it meets the Sea of Marmara, the Golden Horn – known locally as Haliç – branches off northwest. It eventually peters out inland unlike the Sea of Marmara, which leads to the Aegean Sea via the narrow Dardanelles Strait.
Day and night, tankers and container ships are visible along the horizon near the Princess Islands, patiently waiting their turn to pass along the shipping route.
Similarly, Istanbul residents wait too, in cars, on buses, trains and ferries. According to 2021 figures, just shy of 16 million people reside in Istanbul. Many live on one side of the city and work on the other, meaning at any one time a large swathe of the population is on the move.
Navigating the city’s tangled road map can be chaotic at any time of day and sometimes it feels like it’s a wonder that anyone gets anywhere, but they do – making use of road, rail, ship, bridge and tunnel to cross from one continent to another.
Here’s how it’s done:
15 July Martyrs Bridge (15 Temmuz Şehitler Köprüsü)
Originally known as Boğaziçi Köprüsü – or Bosphorous Bridge – this elegant structure was renamed the 15 July Martyrs Bridge after a failed 2016 coup, but locals still fondly refer to it as Boğaziçi Köprüsü, or the First Bridge.
Before it opened on October 29, 1973, the 50th anniversary of the Turkish Republic, the only way to cross from Europe to Asia in Istanbul was by ferry.
The elegant new 1,560-meter (5,118 feet) steel suspension bridge allowed drivers to pass high above the swiftly running waters of the Bosphorus and enjoy sweeping views across to Topkapi Palace and out to the Sea of Marmara in the distance.
In its early days, the bridge attracted walkers who wanted a vantage point to admire the stately white brilliance of the 19th century Büyük Mecediye Mosque down on the water’s edge in Ortaköy.
These days the bridge is only open to pedestrians one day a year when thousands sign up to run the Istanbul Marathon.
Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge
The second bridge linking both continents opened on July 3, 1988 and was named for Fatih Sultan Mehmet, aka Mehmet the Conqueror. He’s the guy who rode into town in 1453 and established Ottoman rule in Constantinople, then capital of the Byzantine Empire.
Sometimes called FSM Köprüsü, it’s another gravity-anchored steel suspension bridge similar in length to the First Bridge and costing a similar toll fee to use.
It spans the narrowest point of the Bosphorus strait, where Persian King Darius I was said to have built a floating bridge in 512 B.C.E.
The traffic deck of the modern incarnation hangs around 200 feet above the water and connects Hısarüstü in the west to Kavacık in the east.
It provides spectacular views over the Bosphorus but no pedestrian access is allowed so only drivers get to appreciate them, a welcome distraction when stuck in weekend midnight traffic jams.

Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge
In 2016, a third suspension bridge opened up across the Bosphorus, near the Black Sea. This one is named for Yavuz Sultan Selim, grandson of Mehmet the Conqueror and an apt choice given his interest in transport. The 16th-century sultan rebuilt the Ottoman fleet and Haliç Tershanesi, the Golden Horn shipyards.
On completion, the bridge broke numerous records. With a 58.8-meter-wide single deck slab, it is the world’s widest suspension bridge, able to carry eight lanes of traffic and a double-track railway line. It’s also the world’s fifth tallest bridge, rising over 322 meters.
The bridge, designed for use by trucks and long-distance traffic heading to central Anatolia and beyond, offers drivers a view for miles out to the Black Sea on clear days.
Çannakale 1915 Bridge
The newest route to span the two continents is the impressive Çannakale 1915 Köprüsü, stretching between Gelibolu on the European side of the Dardanelles to Lapseki over in Asia.
Measuring just short of 2.3 miles, it now claims the world record for the longest suspension bridge span.
The structure soars across the Straits and replaces a one-hour ferry crossing (that in reality can take up to five hours with waiting time) with a six-minute drive at the 50 miles per hour limit.
Designed for speed rather than views, it’s less popular with locals due to to the toll charges.
The bridge opened on March 18, 2022, commemorating the day in 1915 that Turkey was victorious over the Allies in a battle to take control of this vital waterway.

Eurasia Tunnel
The 5.3-kilometer (3.3 mile) underwater section of the Eurasia Tunnel (Avrasya Tüneli in Turkish) is a big drawcard for fans of engineering, but the tunnel’s main appeal is being the fastest way to get from one side of Istanbul to the other.
It’s functional rather than beautiful, with a speed limit of 70 kilometers per hour. Part of a longer nine-mile road link connecting Kazlıçeşme in Europe to Göztepe in Asia, on completion in December 2016 it reduced travel time from 100 minutes to just 15.
The tunnel also became the most practical link between the city’s two airports, Atatürk and Sabiha Gökçen until commercial flights were relocated from Atatürk Airport to the mammoth Istanbul Airport, more than 27 miles northwest of central Istanbul’s Taksim Square.
As with the bridge crossings, toll payments are collected via the Hızlı Geçiş Sistemi. Called HGS for short, this system uses special windscreen stickers that are automatically scanned when vehicles pass through toll gates.
It’s important to have enough credit in your account to cover charges, especially if you’re planning to drive across a border. Unpaid fines mean do not pass go! Don’t worry though. There’s a handy app you can download to track credit and usage.
Marmaray
This underground, intercontinental train service was a long time coming. In 1860, Sultan Abdülmecid I came up with the idea for an undersea crossing in the strait, but died before he could do anything about it.
Another sultan, Abdul Hamid II, was interested when French engineers proposed it to him in 1892, but there was no progress.
More than a hundred years later interest resurfaced and construction on the 13.6 kilometer tunnel started in 2004.
Despite the best of intentions, the rail service didn’t open until October 29, 2013. Deadlines were pushed back when almost every meter dug revealed archaeological finds, some dating back 8,000 years.
It was another six years before all the stations along the line were ready for use.
The tunnel connects Kazlıçeşme on the European side to Ayrılık Çeşmesi on the Asian side, descending up to 200 feet below sea level at its lowest point, making it the world’s deepest immersed tunnel.
All that travelers need in order to take the Marmaray is an Istanbul Card (Istanbul Kart). Available at all major public transport hubs and small kiosks throughout the city, it allows the bearer to hop on and off all modes of public transport at will.

Ferries
They’re not the quickest way to travel between the continents, but there are few travel experiences better than being on a ferry crossing over the Bosphorus.
Feet up on the railing and the wind in your hair, watch the minareted skyline of Istanbul slide by while taking a sip of piping hot Turkish tea and a bite of simit, a sesame seed covered ring of sourdough.
Pure heaven.
The Şehir Hatlar Vapuları (City Lines’ Ferries) were established in 1844 during the Ottoman Empire. As well as crisscrossing and running the length of the Bosphorus, their ferries sail the Sea of Marmara, the Golden Horn and over to the Princes’ Islands.
They also carry cars and passengers on the short trip between Sirkeci and Harem, and on longer journeys to Bursa, Yalova and Mudanya.
Ferries are the epitome of atmosphere and style when it comes to public transport in Istanbul, unlike the buses.
Sure, buses go absolutely everywhere, including one route that covers 63 miles over 78 stops, but they are often uncomfortably crowded and frequently stuck in traffic.
Yet they have one thing in common with the ferries – neither of them continue through the night. If you’re looking for a fast, economical way to get from one side of the Bosphorus to the other in the wee hours, late night minibuses are the way to go.
Late night shared minibuses
Shared minibuses in Istanbul are a close cousin of the dolmuş, small privately run buses which travel set routes like normal buses, but pick up and set down passengers as requested.
Both operate on a cash basis. Dolmuş take their name from the word meaning stuffed in Turkish. How many passengers they carry depends on the number of bodies they can squeeze in (a lot, in case you’re wondering) while yellow minibuses only take as many people as there are seats.
After a night out on the European side of town, partygoers head to the minibus stop in Taksim Square. Most of the drivers seem to have Formula One aspirations, so as soon as they’re full it’s usually pedal to the metal making for a quick trip home.

Supersonic planes will replace conventional jets in our lifetime, says aviation CEO
Boom wants to bring supersonic travel to the masses
Earlier this month, a demonstrator aircraft for what could be the first new civil supersonic plane to be launched since the 1960s took to the skies. It’s a milestone moment in the highly anticipated new era of supersonic travel.
The XB-1, a technology demonstrator aircraft built by Colorado-based Boom Supersonic, successfully completed its first test flight at the Mojave Air & Space Port in California, it was announced March 22.
The XB-1 is the the world’s first independently developed supersonic jet and paves the way for the development of Boom’s commercial plane Overture.
Now, 10 years after the Boom Supersonic project began in 2014, CEO Blake Scholl tells CNN Travel over video call, there are an exciting few months ahead.
The ‘hard part’ is over
“I very much believe in the return of supersonic air travel, and ultimately to bring it to every passenger on every route. And that’s not something that takes place overnight,” says Scholl. “The hard part of building a supersonic jet is making something that’s so sleek, and so slippery, take off and land safely.”
XB-1’s first flight met all of its test objectives, including safely reaching an altitude of 7,120 feet (2,170 meters) and speeds of up to 238 knots (273 miles per hour).
That’s quite a bit below the altitudes reached by commercial airliners, which fly between 31,000 feet to 42,000 feet.
As for Mach 1 – the speed of sound –  that’s about 760 mph, depending on altitude and temperature. But the plan is for XB-1 to achieve that supersonic ambition pretty fast.
“We’re gonna be doing a whole series of flights – 10 to 15 total – over the next five to seven months to break the sound barrier for the first time,” says Scholl.
Aerodynamics, materials, propulsion
There have been only two civil supersonic planes: the Soviet Tupolev Tu-144 and the British-French Concorde, which flew for the last time in October 2003, more than two decades ago.
Now, the industry is abuzz with supersonic and hypersonic projects – from NASA and Lockheed Martin’s “quiet” X-59 aircraft, which limits sonic boom, to Atlanta-based Hermeus, which this week unveiled its first flyable aircraft.
“The advent of digital engineering is a huge enabler for why supersonic flight’s coming back,” explains Scholl. “Aerodynamics, materials, propulsion: Those are the big three areas where we’ve made huge progress versus Concorde.”
Computational fluid dynamics
Back in the 1960s, Concorde was developed in wind tunnels, which meant building costly physical models, running tests, then repeat.
“You just can’t test very many designs, when every iteration costs millions and takes months,” explains Scholl. But Boom has perfected its aircraft’s efficient, aerodynamic design using computational fluid dynamics, which “is basically a digital wind tunnel. We can run the equivalent of hundreds of wind tunnel tests overnight in simulation for a fraction of the cost of a real wind tunnel test.”
XB-1 is made almost entirely from carbon fiber composites, selected for being both strong and lightweight.
Augmented reality vision system
Concorde famously reduced drag when reaching supersonic speeds by having a long, pointed nose on a hinge that tilted forward when taking off, landing and taxiing so the pilots could see the runway.
“Today, we have this amazing thing called a camera and a screen,” says Scholl with a smile, when explaining XB-1’s unique augmented reality vision system. Rather than needing a complex moveable nose and windscreen views, the craft instead makes use of two nose-mounted cameras, digitally augmented with altitude and flight path indications.
“It’s far better than the view ever was on Concorde,” claims Scholl, and the augmented reality symbology will help pilots line up the target and achieve “a beautiful landing every time.”
Fueled by SAF
So, with the aviation industry having a target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, where does a supersonic plane whizzing round at twice the speed of modern, conventional jets fit into all this?
Overture is designed to be powered by conventional jet engines and to run on up to 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).
We’ve covered the so-far slow adoption of SAF before here on CNN Travel, and Scholl is well aware of its current problems.
“There’s not enough of it, and it costs too much, but it is scaling,” says Scholl, but he reckons that one day it’ll be used for all long-haul air travel. It’s the “future of aviation,” he declares.

The need for speed
Scholl concedes that “flying faster is inherently more energy intensive,” but argues that “we shouldn’t have to choose between climate-friendly and passenger-friendly. In fact, we can accelerate the transition towards lower carbon transportation by making sure that the most desirable airplane is also the most climate-friendly.”
He compares today’s transatlantic air travel to “driving across the Atlantic in a not-very-good SUV. Aboard Overture, driving across the Atlantic is gonna be like driving a Tesla across it. And yeah, it’s gonna be more energy-intensive, but from a climate perspective, it doesn’t matter because the energy source is green.”
‘If we have faster airplanes, we don’t need as many’
He also argues the case for other efficiencies offered by faster flight.
“A faster airplane is much more human-efficient, and it’s much more capital-efficient. You can do more flights, with the same airplane and crew,” says Scholl. “We can significantly reduce all of the cost and impact that goes into airplanes by making them faster. if we have faster airplanes, we don’t need as many.”
The reason we don’t use propeller flights between London and New York, he says, is that while it might be less energy-intensive than a jet engine, it would be “more expensive and more impactful overall, because going at half the speed you would need way more.”
He predicts that, in the same manner jet airplanes replaced propeller airplanes, “in your lifetime and mine, supersonic is going to replace today’s jet airliners, and it’s going to be both faster, more sustainable, and more affordable.”
‘Anywhere in the world in four hours for $100’
Back when CNN Travel spoke with Scholl in May 2021, he told us his dream was for people to one day be able to “fly anywhere in the world in four hours for $100.” Three years later, he says it’s still his “North Star.”
“If you look back at Concorde, you know, built out of 1960s technology, this was like a 20,000 quid ticket, and it just wasn’t attainable,” says Scholl.
On the first iteration of Boom’s Overture plane, dubbed Overture One, “our goal is to cut that by a factor of four, and be able to have supersonic flight available to the tens of millions of people who can fly business class today.”
The long-term vision is for later versions of Overture - there’s plans for Overture Two, then Overture Three – will bring supersonic flights on more routes to more passengers at lower costs.
Boom’s goal is to cut flights to “half the time or less than it takes today.” The ultimate goal is “flights that are faster, more affordable, more convenient, more sustainable. And we’re just gonna keep working on that until we can travel effortlessly around the planet.”
2024 is ‘one of the biggest years yet’
Boom aims to carry its first passengers on Overture – between 64 and 80 of them, at Mach 1.7 – before the end of the decade. Presently, it boasts an order book of 130 orders and pre-orders from customers including American Airlines, United Airlines and Japan Airlines.
Scholl says, “2024 is going to be one of the biggest years yet for supersonic flight. Later this year, we’ll open the super-factory in Greensboro, North Carolina, where we’re going to be building Overture. And then we’re very much off to the races.”
Above all, he is proud of leading “a private company with a commercial model that scales,” he says. “The world needs a new innovative maker of commercial airplanes.”

This Italian town is struggling to sell off its empty homes for one euro. Here’s why
Patrica: This Italian town is struggling to sell off its empty homes for €1
Italy’s one-euro-home sales have been attracting a lot of interest over the past few years, with dozens opting to snap up abandoned properties in some of the country’s depopulated towns.
But while towns like Mussomeli in Sicily and Zungoli in Campania have managed to offload various abandoned dwellings to foreigners longing to live the Italian dream, some have struggled to sell their empty homes.
Among them is Patrica, a remote medieval village of barely 3,000 residents located south of Rome, where more than 40 properties deserted in the early 1900s have been left to rot.
Perched on a rocky plateau overlooking the Sacco valley in central Italy, Patrica is an idyllic spot, but life here wasn’t easy for locals in the past.
Abandoned homes
Many left in search of a brighter future elsewhere, leaving their homes empty for decades.
In an attempt to breathe new life into the dying village, the town’s mayor Lucio Fiordaliso has been trying to emulate the success of other Italian villages who’ve put their empty homes up for sale for one euro, or just over a dollar. He’s so far had little success.
“We first mapped all abandoned houses and made an official call out to the original owners to invite them to hand over their dilapidated family properties, but we managed to sell just two homes for one euro,” Fiordaliso tells CNN.

While local authorities in towns left underpopulated due to earthquakes and other natural calamities have the jurisdiction to put abandoned homes up for sale without permission from the owners, this isn’t the case for Patrica and other towns like it.
“We first need the availability of owners, or their heirs, in disposing of their old houses,” says Fiordaliso.
“Only then can we place these properties up for sale with their consent, which makes the process very complicated. Almost impossible.”
Fiordaliso explains that the town received a “positive response” from 10 owners after sending out a “public call to involve them in our one-euro-homes project,” but they withdrew at the last minute. The rest never replied.
Public call
Fiordaliso feels that those who changed their minds may have done so because of issues with other relatives who owned shares of the same property.
Abandoned buildings in old Italian towns are sometimes split between multiple heirs who own just a section – like a bathroom, balcony, kitchen - and nothing can be sold without written consent from all heirs, as per Italian law.
In the past, it was customary for children to inherit parts of their family home, including patches of land, wells and orchards.
But it’s not always a guarantee that relatives will still be on good terms and/or in contact years down the line.
“The disposal of potential one euro homes faced a deadlock as most relatives sharing the same property were at odds with one another for personal reasons or couldn’t agree on the sale, some hardly spoke or knew each other, others lived in distant cities and even abroad,” says the mayor.
In some instances, homes were never officially split between heirs in the past, so the ownership line had broken along the way without a clear indication as to who should be the current owner.
According to Fiordaliso, tracking down the descendants of owners who’d long migrated overseas, mainly to the US, Canada and Argentina and perhaps had different last names, or may have passed on their Italian property to foreigners without notifying Patrica’s town hall, has been a very hard task.
“It’s like looking for a needle in a haystack,” he adds.
The only two abandoned homes that Patrica managed to sell as part of its one-euro scheme were fully owned by two locals, so no liaising with fourth-degree cousins or great-great-grandsons was required, and they could sell the properties without any complications.
Family ties
In situations where family feuds are at play, relatives could choose not to sell their share due to legal issues tied to inheritance disputes, or even as a form of revenge.
And original owners who’ve been living elsewhere for many years may be wary of making themselves known to local authorities and potentially being hit with back taxes for their property and waste disposal charges of up to 2,500 euros (around $2,730) per year, plus unpaid utility bills.
Another reason that the one euro scheme never really kicked off in Patrica could be due to the condition of its forsaken homes.
Some of the houses are simply too neglected to sell, even if the owners were willing to agree to it.
Patrica local Gianni Valleco and his two brothers decided to place their parents’ abandoned home on the market to see what would happen, but soon found that the house was far from desirable.

“We thought, ‘Why not give it a go’? Even if it’s just for one euro, we’d be rid of a heap of useless stones. We were curious to see if someone might be interested anyway in buying it,” says Valleco.
“We were aware that after half a century our parents’ home had turned into rubble, it was totally destroyed, like razed to the ground.
“The roof and most walls had collapsed, leaving an open-air room covered in grass and bushes. All there remained was a patch of land, an ugly garden right in the heart of the historical center.”
According to Valleco, a neighbor had been using what remained of the home to dump their old stuff.
“We then realized nobody would ever buy it,” he says. “It’s a bad investment requiring lots of money to rebuild the house. It’s more worth buying a tiny rural cottage in the surroundings.”
Thankfully, not all of the deserted homes in Patrica that could be potentially sold for one euro are in quite such a terrible state, and some have garnered interest from potential buyers.
“A few foreigners came to see the abandoned one-euro dwellings. There was lots of interest but unfortunately we had nothing to offer them,” says the mayor, adding that those interested were from the US and Europe.
In the meantime, Fiordaliso has been coming up with new ways to boost the town’s appeal in the hope of luring newcomers.
New scheme
The town hall recently funded the makeover of the external façades of some ancient palazzos, prompting several locals to entirely restyle their old family homes and put them to use after decades of neglect.
Local resident Alessandra Pagliarosi took things a step further by turning the 1950s mansion inherited by her husband into an elegant B&B called Patricia.
“We redid the roof, which was practically no longer there, and the interior. The mayor’s move finally gave us a good excuse to fully renovate the property which had been sitting there uselessly,” says Pagliarosi, who benefited from the new tax breaks introduced by the town hall to revive the local economy.
Those who decide to kickstart a commercial activity like an B&B or artisan boutique in the ancient district are exempt from paying taxes on waste disposal, advertisement and public space use for 10 years and granted tax credits for restructuring costs.
“For a small B&B, that would amount to a total of roughly 1,200 euros (around $1,310) per year in tax savings, which is a significant amount of money,” says Pagliarosi.
Foreigners planning to relocate to Patrica and launch a small business are also entitled to the tax benefits.
So far, two new B&Bs and one restaurant have opened up as a result.
Local realtor Ilario Grossi, who runs Immobil Lepini estate agency, located in the nearby town of Ceccano, says several American descendants of emigrant families recently visited Patrica to look at properties.
But the town’s ready-to-occupy homes, with two-bedroom properties starting at 20,000 euros ($21,832,) proved to be more appealing.
“There is interest, but then when many (foreigners) actually see the bad shape of the old homes they’d prefer to opt for turn-key apartments that are already restyled or in need of just minor fixes,” says Grossi.
“So it’s much more convenient to buy one of these newer ones than grab an old building in need of a major renovation, where the final cost would end up being much higher.”
Despite these challenges, Fiordaliso hasn’t given up on selling some of the town’s long neglected homes, even if it means having to negotiate between warring relatives.

Why does the US drive on the right and the UK on the left? Your travel questions answered
Editor’s Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.
In this week’s travel roundup, we bring you transport trivia, Roman engineering marvels and the world’s tastiest dumplings.
Did you know?
You’re probably aware that around 30% of the world’s countries drive on the left while 70% drive on the right. But have you considered why? In Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte had a big hand in it, while in the United States, we need to go back to the time of wagon trains. Read more here.
When flying around the world, and particularly in hot spots such as London, you may have been told your airplane is being kept in a “holding pattern.” We explain what they are and why they happen.
And as airline after airline raises checked bags fees, it makes you wonder why they charge so much? In the United States, at least, an obscure tax rule helps explain why.
Food and drink
The greatest restaurants in Asia for 2024 have been named, with Singapore snagging the most spots on the 50-best list. But Tokyo is home to both the No. 1 and No. 2 eateries.
When exploring the Japanese capital, you’ll find Tokyo’s oldest rice ball restaurant just a short walk from the city’s oldest temple. Onigiri – seaweed-wrapped snacks perfect for eating on the go – are found in convenience stores around Japan, but the 16-seater Onigiri Asakusa Yadoroku draws visitors from around the world.
Bawan, wonton, daifuku, modak and siomay are just some of the Asian entries in our sumptuously packed roundup of the world’s tastiest dumplings, but you should leave room for all the doughy morsels from Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the United States, too.
Rail connections
China has been pouring money into huge overseas infrastructure projects for a decade now. The Southeast Asia one could mean a 2,000-mile (3,220-kilometer) journey from southwest China to Singapore will take just 30 hours. Here’s how that’s going.
A simpler connection was made on Europe’s Channel Tunnel train in 2012, when a British woman and a French man sat beside each other on a warm spring evening. This is what happened next.
Whether you’re in a group, traveling solo or with your new international beau, packing well will make your next rail trip go better. Our partners at CNN Underscored, a product reviews and recommendations guide owned by CNN, have selected 22 must-haves for luxurious train travel in 2024.
Tourism vs. conservation
There’s a new addition to Everest climbers’ packing lists: poop bags. Himalayan hikers will now have to take their excrement away with them as Nepal tries to address a growing waste problem on the world’s highest peak.
In Australia, Horizontal Falls is a sacred natural wonder where seawater surges in a gap between cliffs. For years, it’s been a must-see sight for tourists riding boats right into the action. But a new ban will stop them in their tracks.
Finally, a new resort in the Philippines’ famed Chocolate Hills, a protected natural wonder, has stirred fierce debate on conservation. After a public outcry, the Captain’s Peak Garden and Resort has been temporarily shuttered.
Engineering marvels
Italy is in a race to stop its 12th-century leaning tower in Bologna from collapsing – and the plan is to save it using the same technology that has already restored the country’s more famous lopsided wonder in Pisa.
Spain is also busy getting some long-standing construction tasks off its to-do list. Barcelona’s famous Sagrada Familia cathedral will finally be finished in 2026, officials have confirmed, more than 140 years after building began.
When it comes to enduring European architecture, one civilization excelled above the rest. The continent is dotted with lots of genius Roman creations that still amaze us today. Our guide tells you to where to see them and why.
In case you missed it
This Italian town is struggling to sell off its empty homes for one euro each.
Here’s why.
Spain’s lifestyle of siestas and late nights is making some people unhappy.

A supercomputer is tracking one of most exciting soccer title races for years. It keeps coming up with different predictions
A supercomputer is tracking one of the most exciting English Premier League title races in years and with three clubs involved, separated by a matter of points, it keeps spitting out different predictions as it analyzes thousands of simulations.
While the supercomputer whirs away in the background, the 2023/2024 title race has been something to truly savour, with three powerhouses of English football – Liverpool, Arsenal and defending champion Manchester City – all in contention to win that prestigious crown.
“In the supercomputer’s latest round of 10,000 simulations of the rest of the Premier League season, Liverpool finished top of the pile 47.7% of the time,” said Opta Analyst after the three clubs had played their 29th league game.
“After the previous round of fixtures at the start of the month, Liverpool’s title chances were rated at 35.3%, meaning they increased by 12.4%.”
After Liverpool beat Sheffield United 3-1 on Thursday, there are now three points separating the top three with eight games remaining.
With all three teams now having played 30 matches, the Opta supercomputer is giving Liverpool a 45% chance of winning the league, Manchester City 33.6% and Arsenal 21.4%.
“Liverpool an 85.5% chance of winning that [Sheffield United] match, and so the fact that they struggled to break down the team set to break the Premier League record for goals conceded in a season appears to have hurt their title chances,” said Opta Analyst on Friday, adding that the Reds’ chances of winning the league had dropped from 47.7% to 45% after the midweek round of fixtures.
Liverpool leads the title race on 70 points, with Arsenal second on 68 and City third on 67. Arsenal has the superior goal difference of the three teams with +48, while Liverpool is on +42 and City +38.
Twists and turns
Liverpool’s result follows a successful night for Manchester City and Arsenal on Wednesday, with both teams easing to victories.
City looked to have arguably the toughest tie, facing an emerging Aston Villa which is bidding for a place in the Champions League next season.

The defending champion was also without key men Kevin De Bruyne and Erling Haaland, who were rested ahead of Saturday’s league game against Crystal Palace and the team’s Champions League quarterfinal against Real Madrid on Tuesday.
But, in the absence of both stars, Phil Foden produced a masterclass to ensure his team kept pace with its title rivals, scoring three goals in a comfortable 4-1 win for City.
Whilst serving as another reminder of how good Foden has been this season – the Englishman has now scored 21 goals in all competitions, providing 10 assists – it was also a display of might from City which has a squad depth capable of winning a championship.
Meanwhile, Arsenal breezed to a 2-0 win over relegation-threatened Luton. Manager Mikel Arteta was able to rest some of his key players and still get the job done with relative ease, with Martin Ødegaard’s strike and an own goal was enough for the host.
In truth, after recent performances, it’s hard to see any of the top three dropping points until now and the end of the season.
But, if history tells us anything, they’ll be multiple twists and turns during the run-in.
Liverpool play Manchester United at Old Trafford on Sunday, having lost 4-3 to its fierce rival in a FA Cup quarterfinal last month, and City boss Guardiola is aware of how close the remainder of the season it’s likely to be.
“If we win all our games it will be down to the last day because they are not five, six, seven points in front,” Guardiola said after the Aston Villa win.
Twice in recent years, City has only been confirmed champion on the final day of the season.
“It will not be easy. I see Liverpool and Arsenal dropping points but you never know,” added Guardiola.
“We have to show up and do our job and don’t regret that we should have won that game because they lost the game after.
“We cannot do anything. We cannot control what they do. We have to win our games, that’s all we can do.”
While City could win a fourth consecutive title, Arsenal is looking to win its first for 20 years.
For much of the two decades since Arsenal’s title-winning ‘Invincible’ season in 2004, the Gunners have struggled to really compete at the top of the table but look to have finally turned the page on a difficult chapter for the club.

Liverpool’s quadruple dream comes to an end in FA Cup quarterfinal thriller against Manchester United
Under Arteta, Arsenal looks rejuvenated and has continued to prove itself amid plenty of doubters this season.
The North London club seemingly threw away the league title last season, letting slip a healthy lead at the top of the table as Manchester City cruised past them.
This year, though, Arteta hopes it will be a different story.
“I can’t really remember how I was feeling last year. I was very excited, we kept growing, we tried our best and in the end we didn’t do enough to win it,” he said after beating Luton.
“Sometimes you just have to recognise the consistency and quality of other teams like we did and try again and go again, and here we are.”
For Liverpool, meanwhile, there is a sense that this season’s title race is all about one man, Jürgen Klopp.
The German has simply revolutionised the club and his decision to leave Liverpool at the end of the season came as a shock to the world of football.
The team now looks focused on winning a league title as the perfect way of saying thank you to Klopp after his years of service.
After going 1-0 up in the first half against Sheffield United – Klopp said Darwin Núñez’s opener was one of his “favourite goals ever” – Liverpool was pegged back by a Conor Bradley own goal.
Chasing a seemingly lost cause, Nunez had successfully charged down United goalkeeper Ivo Grbic’s clearance and the ball ended up in the back of the net.
And goals from Alexis Mac Allister and Cody Gakpo ensured Liverpool remains the supercomputer’s favorite to lift the Premier League trophy.
“As a manager, you have to take it like you get it,” Klopp said after the win. “I would prefer to be 5-0 up at that moment [when Sheffield United equalized] already but that’s tricky.
“Then obviously we controlled the game but there are different ways to control a football game and the way we controlled it today was not the right one with not enough creating.
“What you have to do, we saw that after 60 minutes, you have to accelerate, you have to speed up, you have to overlap, underlap – and that’s what we did all of a sudden.”
Is this the most exciting EPL title race ever?
With Manchester City dominating the league title in recent seasons – it’s won in four of the last five years – only Liverpool has really been able to truly challenge Guardiola’s history makers of late.
But this year is a different prospect, with there being a legitimate three-way title race for the first time in a very long while.
The last time three teams were truly pitted against each other at the summit of the league was in 2014, where Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool all stood a chance going into the final two fixtures of the season.
City eventually pipped its rivals to the title, with Liverpool two points behind in second and Chelsea another two points behind in third.
With neither side looking like dropping their form, the neutral will be hoping this year will also go down to the wire.

Thanks to Caitlin Clark, women’s basketball is now prime time viewing
Two years ago, I could never have predicted the hype which surrounds tonight’s NCAA women’s basketball Final Four.
It was only last year that this casual, although at times serious, sports fan met a basketball hall of famer and didn’t recognize her. Fortunately, former NCAA head coach Muffet McGraw was kind enough to look past my transgression.
My inability to know who I was talking to is definitely on me, but my guess is that among most casual sports fans I wouldn’t have been alone at that time in lacking knowledge about women’s NCAA basketball.
That has all changed. Women’s college basketball is not just on the map for casual fans, it’s a star on the map – thanks at least, in large part, to Iowa star Caitlin Clark.
Let’s first talk about television ratings. Over 12 million people watched Clark’s Hawkeyes defeat Angel Reese’s LSU on Monday night, according to ESPN. In today’s media environment, the idea that over 12 million would watch a cable program that isn’t the NFL is unheard of.
You examine the cable ratings on an average night, and the top programs are usually pulling in well less than five million.
If it were a network prime time broadcast, Monday’s game would have been a top 45 show in 2023.
In fact, most big sports events don’t pull in over 12 million. The Iowa-LSU game had more viewers than the average MLB World Series, NBA Final or Stanley Cup game last season.
I want you to look at that prior sentence again and fully digest it. Women’s college basketball is beating America’s pastime. If that doesn’t say the sport has arrived in the American psyche, I don’t know what does.
Not surprisingly, the viewership for the Iowa-LSU game broke the all time record for a women’s game. It easily dethroned last year’s championship game between these two squads, which came in at a little under 10 million. Even more amazingly, that game, unlike Monday’s, was available for free on ABC.
You’ll note too that both the new record and old record involved Iowa and LSU. Before last year’s championship game, the highest viewership for a women’s game was more than 20 years ago (before the splintering of media). Just 5.7 million folks tuned into that game.
In other words, the new record more than doubled the one from the pre-Clark era.
Perhaps, what’s most interesting about the viewership record occurring on Monday night is that the game wasn’t a championship game. It wasn’t even a semi-final. It was an Elite Eight matchup.
Of course, Iowa is no stranger to widely watched non-championship games. The viewership for their previous three games were 6.9 million, 4.9 million and 3.2 million. All of those would have been records for non-Final Four or championship games prior to this season.
The 6.9 million would have been the biggest telecast in women’s college basketball history at any stage prior to last season.
Note too that 6.7 million Americans tuned into the game following Iowa-LSU on Monday night (UConn-USC), so this isn’t solely a Clark phenomenon.
There are alternate ways we can gauge interest in the tournament this season. Take a gander at Google searches for women’s college basketball.
This year there have been more searches since Google started tracking it in the early 2000s. This year is on track to more than double the previous record, which was last year. Last year was double the record before Clark became a household name.
But it’s not just prior tournaments this year’s women’s tournament is beating. The other big entertainment event of the last week was Beyoncé’s new album release. Far more people Googled about the NCAA women’s games than they did about Beyoncé.
The tournament is beating politicians, too. More people have been searching women’s college basketball than for US President Joe Biden. When you are beating the president, you know you’re being talked about.
The interest in the tournament goes beyond mere curiosity.
Every year, millions of Americans fill out their tournament brackets. Usually, it’s a men’s tournament bracket. Increasingly, a lot of Americans are filling a women’s bracket.
This year more than 4 million Americans filled out a bracket on one of the major websites (e.g. ESPN and NCAA) that feature them. Over three million filled them out on ESPN alone.
These numbers would be impressive on its own, but it’s even more so given where we were before Clark became a household name in the past two seasons.
In 2022, only about 1.5 million Americans filled out a women’s tournament bracket on ESPN.com. This means that the number of people filling out women’s brackets has more than doubled from just a few seasons ago.
Some of those brackets are just for bragging rights, but some will have an office money pool associated with them.
Indeed, there are a lot of people who are putting their money on the line when it comes to seeing the women play.
Check the prices for the men’s and women’s college basketball Final Four. Tickets for both have usually been going for hundreds of dollars on Stubhub. More than that, the tickets to the women’s tournament are often the more sought item in the past week.
That is, depending on the time you check, it will cost you more to see the women’s final four than the men’s.
Two years ago, I think most would have found that to be shocking. Given the last two weeks, I don’t think anyone is that surprised.

DJ Burns Jr.: March Madness star is leading a surprising Final Four run and earns praise from Nikola Jokić
March Madness is a time for unheralded players to become national darlings with magical moments and lead surprising tournament runs.
And no one better symbolizes college basketball’s allure than DJ Burns Jr.
The six-foot-nine-inch, 275-pound center has led No. 11 NC State to the Final Four of the 2024 NCAA men’s tournament, beating a host of highly-seeded teams on the way to a semifinal spot.
But it’s not just on the court where he’s earning plaudits – Burns has become an internet sensation with his dainty footwork, forceful drives to the basket and the swagger he has exuded.
He was seen talking to Duke fans, dancing in the middle of the court during crunch time of crucial victories, all while being a dominant force with the basketball in his hand.
All in all, Burns seems to be relishing his time in the spotlight and is earning himself a burgeoning reputation, even among the best players the game has ever seen.
Two-time NBA MVP Nikola Jokić – a player whose languid, almost nonchalant nature bears similarities to Burns – couldn’t help praising the fifth-year center.
“He’s amazing,” Jokić said about Burns. “I think he’s so skilled, especially lefty. Seems like teammates like to play with him. That’d be a good guy.”
It’s not just in basketball spheres where he’s getting attention.
According to reports, Burns has garnered interest from members of the NFL community for his quick feet and imposing stature.
Multiple football reporters, including Senior Bowl executive director Jim Nagy and Fox Sports’ Peter Schrager, have said that they had received communications from NFL teams outlining their potential interest in watching Burns should he try out as an offensive tackle in football.
Although Burns has not expressed any interest in swapping the hardwood for the gridiron, it all speaks to the growing reputation of a unique basketball player.
All-around talent
From Rock Hill, South Carolina, Burns has always played basketball.
At York Preparatory Academy, he scored over 1,000 points and 1,000 rebounds and – according to the ratings of 247Sports.com, which ranks high school prospects entering the college system – Burns was ranked the fifth-best prospect in the state of South Carolina in the class of 2018.
Burns wasn’t just deft in the way he handled a basketball. He also learned to play multiple instruments as a youth – including the standup bass, tuba, piano and saxophone. His mom, Takela, says his musical proclivities help his basketball style, telling CNN affiliate WRAL earlier this week: “He plays to a beat.”
His mom was a school administrator while his dad, Dwight Sr., is a probation and parole agent for York County, helping recently released inmates try to rebuild their lives on the outside.
The NC State star grew up around people from different backgrounds, with his grandmother running a foster home and his parents taking in other children from unstable homes.
“It’s a part of how I grew up,” Burns’ mom, Takela, told the Rock Hill Herald in 2016, “and I wanted to make sure the kids had something else besides sports to kind of make sure they keep their time spent diversely.
“Our household serves,” Takela added.
Although Burns has received negative comments about his size, his mom says it “fuels him when people are ugly” towards him.
He committed to the University of Tennessee after high school, but after not playing a game during his redshirt first season, transferred to Winthrop University in his hometown.
There, Burns honed his basketball game over three seasons in South Carolina and was named Big South Conference Player of the Year in his junior season by setting career highs in points per game, rebounds and field goal percentage.
He reached 1,000 career points in just his third season with the team, becoming the fifth player in program history to do so before their senior season.
Burns transferred to NC State ahead of the 2022/23 season, quickly becoming a vital member of the team’s rotation in his debut season.
But it was in the Wolfpack’s 2024 March Madness tournament where Burns has blossomed into a star.
Magical run
NC State came into March Madness as the 11th seed and wasn’t predicted for anything remarkable.
But, with Burns at center and the team’s underdog mentality, they have shocked the college basketball scene.
The Wolfpack first beat No. 6 Texas Tech, 80-67, with Burns scoring 16 points in 16 minutes, before overcoming first-round national darling No. 14 Oakland, 79-73. Burns racked up 24 points in 42 minutes in a dominant performance in the win over Oakland.
A further shock 67-58 victory over No. 2 Marquette followed in the Sweet 16 before Sunday’s incredible win over No. 4 Duke – one of college basketball’s historic powerhouses – led by Burns’ season-high 29 points, thanks to his sheer power and fleet-footedness.
Although Burns’ skills on the court had already caught the eye in previous rounds, it was in the win over Duke in which the nation saw his carefree, joyous personality.
Burns was seen smiling throughout the Elite Eight match-up, dancing mid-court during a crucial review near the end of the game and skipping to the bench after being substituted.
“He’s just a fun-loving, people person who loves having fun and enjoys life,” his dad, Dwight Sr., told CBS Sports after the Duke victory. “He was raised to enjoy life. He just loves the game. This is all just fun for him.”
The 23-year-old Burns credits his personality to his upbringing. “I was raised in a happy environment,” the NC State told reporters. “I try to take that with me everywhere I go.”
But that doesn’t take away from his fiery competitiveness.
Social media clips showed Burns exchanging words with some of the Duke fans in attendance, shouting, “Your season is over,” to some dismayed Blue Devils spectators.
Whatever happens when NC State faces No. 1 Purdue in the Final Four on Saturday – the Wolfpack’s first appearance at the March Madness semifinal stage since 1983, coincidentally when they also won their last national championship – Burns has become a college basketball star with his magical run.
And who knows, we could see him pulling on helmet and pads in the future too.

They scaled one of the world’s largest unclimbed rock faces. Blizzards and falling ice almost stopped them
In a world now hyper connected by technology, transport links and our smartphone screens, there are few places that can truly be described as untouched. But for climber Alex Honnold, some such places, found in the harshest and most unforgiving of environments, still exist and are ripe for adventure.
Honnold had palms sweating and pulses racing when he climbed Yosemite’s 3,200 foot granite monolith El Capitan without any safety ropes – a mind-boggling achievement immortalized in the breathtaking BAFTA and Oscar winning National Geographic documentary “Free Solo.”
Following the success of the film and his rise to stardom, Honnold set his sights on Ingmikortilaq, a formidable and unclimbed 3,750-foot rock wall jutting from Greenland’s frigid icy waters. The steep rock is more than double the height of the Empire state building.
“I’m never going to do another climbing project that goes to the Oscars, you know? I can just set that expectation aside and I can focus on the projects that I’m excited about, that I’m inspired by,” he tells CNN Sport.
The 38-year-old athlete, alongside pro climbers Hazel Findlay and Mikey Shaefer, ventured to the formidable seacliff, known locally as “the separate one,” in a six-week expedition that featured in National Geographic’s documentary “Arctic Ascent.”
Honnold has done many first ascents all over the world, but says, that he’d “never done a first ascent of that magnitude, of a wall of that size.”
Taking on one of the world’s biggest unscaled walls might be the stuff of dreams for any climber, but the conditions, less so: Honnold and his team were forced to battle unpredictable weather, snow storms, tumbling loose rock and delayed delivery of their climbing equipment.
In spite of his reputation, Honnold is not entirely unflappable, describing sea cliff Ingmikortilaq as “pretty intimidating” and “daunting,” due to the swirling rock changing in rock type and quality.
“The first time we saw the wall from the boat, we all were pretty, you know, we’re like, ‘Oh, no, that’s a lot’,” he says.
Findlay, who took on the first ascent alongside Honnold, tells CNN even with careful planning and a TV crew, the team faced a surprising number of “unknowns,” not least the pressure and expectation they felt of working on the documentary.
“I think as a climber, you kind of get used to going into things with that level of unknown. I don’t know if you can really have an adventure without unknowns, that’s definitely just part of the experience,” Findlay explains.
“But when you’re making it for a TV show, there’s this added pressure: you really do kind of have to succeed or otherwise that money gets wasted and people’s jobs are on the line.”
After weeks of traveling to the cliff with a team including glaciologist Dr. Heïdi Sevestre, Greenlandic guide Adam Kjeldsen and adventurer Aldo Kane, the climbers set their sights on the formidable buttress.
“That wall was just really loose, it was just a lot harder to manage the risks, we felt like we could do everything possible to make it safe, and it still could be too dangerous,” Findlay adds.
Honnold explains he approached the six-week expedition and “almost overwhelming challenge” of the climb the same way he does all his projects: “breaking things down into things that are manageable.”
He adds: “I think a big part of doing things that other people find scary is broadening your comfort zone to the point that things that you used to think were scary are just no longer scary.

“That has meant consistently scaring myself in different ways, consistently doing things that are a small step beyond what I felt comfortable with before.”
He adds that 10 years ago, many aspects of the expedition would have been very scary for him.
“If you do something routinely for 20 years, it’s just not that scary. I think a lot of viewers see that and they’re like, ‘Oh, he lives a normal life like I do, and then every once in a while he does things like this’.
“No, no, this is what I do five days a week, all year round for the last 20 years,” he chuckles.
Warnings from a warming planet
Before making it to Ingmikortilaq, the team collected data to help inform a “health check” of Eastern Greenland, which hadn’t been completed in some 20 years.
The team studied glaciers, icebergs, fjord waters, and rock faces with the aim of increasing our knowledge of the impact climate change is having on this vital, fragile part of our planet, which will have ultimately have reverberations across the world.
This included a climb up a 1,500-foot rock face, known as the Pool Wall, to take real-time depth and density measurements of a rarely studied section of Greenland’s ice cap.
“Behind these really cool walls, we did some useful science. That is win, win, all the way across the world,” Honnold explains.
“So much of modern science just has to do with access: if you can get the right person to the right place, they can make meaningful contributions to science with relatively little effort,” he adds.

Sevestre tells CNN that the Arctic is currently warming three to four times faster than the rest of the world.
“By being able to better understand what’s happening to Greenland, this helps us to provide better data and better projections on how the rest of the world could be impacted by Arctic changes,” she explains.
A recent study from the California Institute of Technology found that the Greenland ice sheet is losing an average of 30 million metric tons of ice an hour on average, as a result of human-caused global warming.
Sevestre explains that “our present and our future is intimately connected to Greenland.”
The island holds enough ice to increase sea levels by six to seven meters, adding that cities like London, New York and Miami are on the “front line,” she adds.
“And at the moment, we have a choice: do we continue investing in fossil fuels as much as we are today? If we want to give a chance to Greenland and give a chance to our own collective future, we really need to think long and hard about how much we want it.”
“We’re just agreeing passively to invest more and more into fossil fuels. But we really need to understand how high the stakes really are. We could totally get a meter of sea level rise by 2070.
“I mean, this is tomorrow for the younger generations,” she adds.

From cult classics to charming comedies: what happened when golf got the Hollywood treatment
Like a professional athlete’s performance, sporting movies are often hit and miss.
While some become cult favorites, others fall by the wayside after struggling in the hinterland between dramatization and sporting action.
Certain sports lend themselves to getting the Hollywood treatment, and arguably golf falls into that category, perhaps because of the slower pace of play and the focus oftentimes on the personalities away from the course rather than on the action.
‘Caddyshack’
This 1980 laugh-a-minute romp was the first of its kind and brought humor to the typically stuffy world of golfing country clubs.
The plot revolves around a high school student – played by Michael O’Keefe – and his journey to obtain a college scholarship.
During his time at Bushwood Country Club, O’Keefe’s character becomes involved in a rivalry amongst a prominent, stuck-up member of the club – Judge Elihu Smails (played by Ted Knight) – and a boisterous, jokester guest named Al Czervik (played by legendary comedian Rodney Dangerfield).
Although initially beginning as a caddie for Smails in the match at the culmination of the movie, O’Keefe is thrust into the fray midway through and eventually holes the winning putt as a member of Czervik’s team as the hero of the film.
Elsewhere, there is a subplot throughout the film of the country club’s clumsy, dimwitted greenskeeper – played by Bill Murray – and his struggles to kill a destructive gopher amidst dreams of winning the Masters while destroying flowers and musing about the Dalai Lama’s golf skills and spiritual tips.
Also starring Chevy Chase, the film’s lighthearted nature and unique style earned itself a vibrant fanbase and even a sequel, though ‘Caddyshack II’ was universally panned when it was released eight years later.
In 2002, ESPN wrote that ‘Caddyshack’ was arguably “the funniest sports movie ever made.”
Perhaps just as famous as the film, the movie’s theme song – “I’m Alright” by Kenny Loggins – became a top 10 US hit, with golfing great Tiger Woods telling CNN Sport back in 2017 would be the soundtrack to his perfect day.
‘Happy Gilmore’
Arguably one of the most famous sports films of all time, ‘Happy Gilmore’ is an all-time classic.
The movie tells the story of the journey of Happy Gilmore – played by Adam Sandler – from failing ice hockey player to golf phenom after discovering his natural gifts on the course.
Gilmore’s newfound golfing skills present him with the opportunity to save his grandmother’s house from foreclosure. However, the rough-and-tumble Gilmore struggles to acclimatize to golf’s polished environment.
The film’s story hinges on Gilmore’s battle with his new rival, Shooter McGavin. The rivalry between the two and and the lengths McGavin will go to put Gilmore off helped the movie blossom into a comedy reference point in pop culture when it was released in 1996, with both sports and movie fans celebrating its legacy.
Subsequently, both Sandler and Christopher McDonald, who played McGavin, made sure to hold on to their ties to the movie in the years since, even reigniting their rivalry to celebrate the film’s 25th anniversary in 2021.
For Ladies European Tour winner Amy Boulden, the film’s legacy is left with the non-golfing community who remember themes from it even though they aren’t big fans of the sport.
“With ‘Happy Gilmore,’ the funny thing is that there are so many non-golfers who would know what the ‘Happy Gilmore swing’ is or they’ve watched the film,” Boulden told CNN’s Living Golf in 2021.
“And I think that’s great that it’s got so many people from outside of golf interested and they’ve watched the movie and then they’ll go to the driving range and just try to replicate that iconic golf swing.”
Boulden, who says that ‘Happy Gilmore’ is her favorite golfing movie, also admits that the scenes where Gilmore is struggling with the short-game element of golf is extremely relatable to everyday players.
‘Tin Cup’
Golf and romance don’t seem like two components that might mix well in a movie. But through Kevin Costner and Rene Russo, ‘Tin Cup’ attempts to forge a niche of its own comprised of seemingly juxtaposed genres.
The movie tells the story of Costner’s Roy ‘Tin Cup’ McAvoy – a club pro who has lost his way at becoming a professional golfer and ended up working at a course in Texas.
When psychiatrist Dr. Molly Griswold – played by Russo – walks through the door and asks for lessons, McAvoy’s life is upended. Through their time together, ‘Tin Cup’ ends up falling for Griswold. However, as fate would have it, Griswold is married to McAvoy’s former college teammate, David Simms.
The film shows McAvoy’s journey of attempting to win over Griswold and, in doing so, reclaim some of his golfing credibility by qualifying for the US Open.
While the film didn’t receive rave reviews from critics, it has remained in the public consciousness for some of its more famous moments, notably the scene featuring McAvoy hitting a series of balls into a water hazard during the last round of the US Open.
In a real life twist, when British golfer Eddie Pepperell ran out of balls because he hit so many into a pond in 2019, it was compared to ‘Tin Cup.’
A key element of the film is McAvoy’s relationship with his friend and caddie, Romeo Posar, who is portrayed by Cheech Marin. Boulden gave the pair’s interaction the stamp of approval, saying elements of it exactly mirror what happens with the pros and caddies in real life.
Boulden highlighted the scene when McAvoy wants to use a driver, but Posar advises him to go for an iron. Posar snaps his driver over his knee, something Boulden thinks is quite a bit more dramatic than reality.
“You definitely have to have the right personality for you,” Boulden told CNN Sport in 2021, “but you also have to have someone who can bring you out of the shot if you’re going to make the wrong decision.
“Like maybe with that decision right there, the caddie was probably in the right of maybe to hit an iron down there rather than a driver. I think that’s where you really need to have that trust with each other as well.”
‘The Phantom of the Open’
This charming film details the journey of Maurice Flitcroft – played by Mark Rylance – who decides to enter the 1976 British Open despite having never played a round of golf before.
The movie shows Flitcroft’s quest to achieve his seemingly improbable goal as well as his fight against the established golfing hierarchy.
The 46-year-old crane operator from a northern English town did make it to the storied major – sporting plastic shoes, a fishing hat, false teeth and a set of cheap mail-order clubs – before carding a 49-over-par 121, the worst score ever carded in the Open’s history.
The entrance laws to the tournament were changed after Flitcroft’s appearance, but the movie is about more than just what happens on the course; as its tag line says: “Every dreamer deserves a shot.”
‘From the Rough’
This movie recounts Catana Starks’ trailblazing journey in 1986 to become the first woman ever to coach a college men’s golf team.
Starks, who is played by Taraji P. Henson, is a former swimming coach at Tennessee State University when she is tasked with creating a men’s golf team.
She recruits a ragtag group of golfers from across the globe to come to the university and be part of her team.
Things begin poorly for Starks, with division and arguments between the team. But through her determination and inspiration, her team gels and wins a movie-ending tournament.
Starks’ achievements were recognized in 2014 when she was inducted into the National Black College Alumni Hall of Fame.

Muhammad Ali’s ‘Thrilla in Manila’ trunks poised to sell for $6 million at auction
Muhammad Ali’s white satin boxing trunks from his epic “Thrilla in Manila” bout with rival Joe Frazier went up for auction on Thursday and are expected to sell for upwards of $6 million.
Auction house Sotheby’s said the trunks from the October 1975 bout in the Philippines, which was won by Ali and marked a brutal finish to perhaps the greatest trilogy in boxing history, will be up for auction until April 12.
The trunks, which feature a black trim at the waistband and black piping running down the side of each leg, are inscribed by Ali’s assistant trainer and corner man, Drew “Bundini” Brown and signed by Ali in black Sharpie.
According to Sotheby’s, the trunks were auctioned in 1988 from Bundini’s storage locker after his death for around $1,000 and have since made their way through the auction market. They were last auctioned in 2012 for just over $150,000.
In the sweltering heat of a Philippine afternoon, the world of boxing witnessed a brutal spectacle as Ali and Frazier fought each other for the third and final time in a clash of wills that etched itself into the annals of sporting history.
In what proved to be a frightfully punishing encounter, Ali retained the heavyweight crown when Frazier’s trainer would not allow his fighter to answer the bell for the 15th round.
After the most trying fight of his storied career, Ali said it was the closest thing to death that he had ever felt.

In the first of three bouts between the two boxers, Frazier broke Ali’s unbeaten record when he knocked him down with a left hook in the 15th round en route to winning by unanimous decision in March 1971.
Ali got revenge when he outpunched Frazier for a unanimous 12-round decision in January 1974, setting the stage for the “Thrilla in Manila” nearly two years later.
Ali, whose record-setting boxing career, unprecedented flair for showmanship and controversial stands made him one of the best-known figures of the 20th century, died in June 2016 aged 74 of septic shock due to unspecified natural causes.

Many intimate Renaissance portraits were hidden behind covers — this new exhibition explores why
Editor’s Note: Untold Art History investigates lesser-known stories in art, spotlighting unsung and pioneering artists you should know, as well as uncovering new insights into influential artworks that radically shift our understanding of them.
Half a millennium ago, the Protestant rebel priest Martin Luther sent out a number of small paintings as a marital announcement with political implications. He’d commissioned German painter Lucas Cranach the Elder to commemorate his controversial union with the nun Katharina von Bora in 1525 through complementary round portraits concealed in wooden boxes. Before long, their allies had received the secretive gift that boldly rejected Catholicism’s rules around clerical celibacy.
If it had not been for his death weeks prior, one of the recipients might have been one of Luther’s greatest defenders, the German nobleman Friedrich the Wise of Saxony, who had earlier that year commissioned his own covert portraits — for more private, lovestruck reasons. A pair of carved images concealed in walnut canisters reveal his own visage and that of his mistress, Anna Rasper, who bore him four children but was a commoner. Ornate carving on the covers — a centaur on Friedrich’s and a siren for Anna’s — evoked ideas of virility, fertility and desire.
Today, we think of Renaissance portraiture as paintings on canvas or church walls, viewed openly. But an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, “Hidden Faces: Covered Portraits of the Renaissance,” reveals how many works of art from the period were deliberately covered by painted panels or shutters, or contained additional compositions on their reverse side. As objects, they were meant to be handled, opened and flipped over as needed.
“These multisided and covered portraits have never been the subject of an exhibition before,” said the show’s curator, Alison Manges Nogueira, in a video call with CNN. “(We want) to give visitors a sense of these works as three-dimensional objects. It’s a new way of looking at this material — even to people in the field. A lot of (it) is new, because the reverses or covers of many of these portraits often are not well published.”
Researchers now know, from artists’ inventories in England, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain that this trend persisted for centuries, according to the exhibition. Many works that we see today might no longer be complete: Portraits and their covers — the latter which often depicted scenes or symbols meant to offer insights into the sitters’ characters — are often separated today, and exhibited, sold or acquired as standalone works.
“It’s similar to altarpieces where the (panels) get divided up over time, sometimes to sell them for a greater price… not only have portraits been separated from the covers, but often the backs of paintings get cut down or thinned, so that the reverse imagery is eradicated,” Nogueira explained. “The reverse of an image may have a coat of arms, and that’s considered secondary today, like the B-side, and so it’s often ignored.”
Enhancing the experience
Covering portraits heightened the viewer’s experience of engaging with them, whether romantic or political in nature (though there were practical reasons, too, such as protecting them in transit, as many were gifts). The practice also follows a “long tradition” of obscuring sacred imagery, Nogueira said added, to “enhance the divine nature of an object.”
In “Hidden Faces,” the museum reunites several works and shows theoretical companions for others.
The exhibition includes works by Albrecht Dürer, Titian and Hans Holbein. One piece is a circular cover painting by Titian, which features Cupid on the back of a lion and once concealed the (now lost) artist’s portrait of a Venetian noblewoman. Another painting, a portrait of a man by the 15th-century painter Jacometto, features on its reverse side a delicately rendered male deer in a chained collar — a symbol of fidelity. Alongside its companion portrait, of a woman in a white headscarf, the painting was likely fitted in a closed portrait box featuring scenes and symbols of love, devotion and grief — although the relationship between the two people is unclear, the context hints at a romantic connection.
There were plenty of reasons these formats were appealing to artists — they offered more space to allude to their subjects’ virtues or inner lives, or experiment with new motifs. (Nogueira points to the back of a late 15th-century portrait by Hans Memling in the exhibition that features an “astounding, highly naturalistic” botanical still life — a tradition that wouldn’t be popularized until the following century.)
By the 16th and 17th centuries, concealed portraits had became popular in more portable forms too, including in accessories like lockets, watches and false coins, as the exhibition charts. Erotic images, too, benefitted from clandestine curtains and flaps in bound books.
Opaque wooden or canvas covers began to fall out of favor toward the 17th century, possibly as glass barriers rose in popularity as another means of protection (if not disguise), Nogueira noted. But the centuries-long tradition has left an aspect of the Renaissance ripe for more study.
“We know that, during the Renaissance, a lot of imagery was intended to be enigmatic — it was intended to be interpreted in many ways and to kind of spark discussion,” Nogueira said. “And so if we find some of it confusing today, it’s not just because we’re centuries removed — it was intended to be that way.”
“There is something very timeless about trying to solve a puzzle, or interpret an image that is unclear, and there is a lot of imagery in the exhibition that defies explanation,” she added. “It’s very playful.”

The hidden meanings behind photographer Nona Faustine’s nude self-portraits
For over a decade, the photographer Nona Faustine shot self-portraits in and around New York City, in many instances posing fully nude apart from a pair of crisp white pumps. Faustine’s captivating photographs immerse viewers into often-forgotten histories; the series, “White Shoes,” highlights the city’s historic role in the transatlantic slave trade, as well as broader narratives about the perception of Black bodies in the arts.
It is currently on display at the Brooklyn Museum in an exhibition that marks the first solo show for Faustine, a Brooklyn native. Its photographs take viewers to locations across all five of New York City’s boroughs built — in many cases, literally — on enslaved people’s legacies.
Faustine was introduced to photography by her father and uncle, who brought her first camera when she was four years old, and took her first photography classes in elementary school. She began the body of work from which “White Shoes” is drawn during graduate studies at the International Center of Photography (ICP) program at Bard College.
“All my knowledge, everything I know about photography, and everything I know about history and life is part of the work. My heart and soul is in that series,” Faustine told CNN in an email. “It is fine art, conceptual and documentary photography combined.”
For centuries, New York City played a significant role in the enslavement of Black people. As early as the 1620s, Dutch settlers utilized enslaved labor to help build out the colony of New Amsterdam which became the city.
“Up to the Civil War, Wall Street, New York City financed the slavocracy in the south through its financing of the rising market for cotton,” explained Jacob Morris, the head of the Harlem Historical Society and architect of legislation to create a freedom trail in the city. “There was a lot of support for the system and the South, because of our making a lot of money off of (slavery) through the banking system.”
Enslaved people were sold at slave markets in New York City on Wall Street in Lower Manhattan starting for over 50 years in the 18th century. By 1730, forty-two percent of White households in the city enslaved Black people — the second-largest percentage of household slave ownership, after Charleston, South Carolina, in the United States.
Baring all, and bearing witness
Throughout “White Shoes,” Faustine wears a pair of white kitten heels — a symbol, she explained, of the pressures faced by Black women and girls to conform to Western beauty standards and the White patriarchy.
The series’ opener, a 2012 image titled “Venus of Vlacke Bos” (Vlacke Bos is Dutch for Flatbush), serves to highlight the impact of slavery in and on Brooklyn — in 1790, it was recorded that the borough had the highest number of enslaved people north of the Mason-Dixon line. In the photograph, Faustine is nude save for her heels and a pair of gloves, sitting on blue silk fabric in a studio with hands folded over her knee in a stylized, delicate pose. A tiara is balanced on her head, representing Western royalty and the dehumanizing ways White people treated enslaved Black women.
Faustine is nude throughout the early images in “White Shoes,” a conscious decision made, the photographer explained, to commemorate her ancestors, Black women today — and herself. In particular, she cited taking inspiration from daguerreotypes of Saartjie “Sarah” Baartman, a South African woman trafficked to Europe and exhibited as part of a human zoo in the early 19th-century.
“If you look back into the history of the Black body in art and photography, it’s highly problematic,” Faustine told CNN in an interview during a press preview for her exhibit. “I have never walked into a museum, until recently, and seen myself depicted on the walls the way I want to be represented.”

“This is a Black female body who’s given birth, who survived, who is a free woman and who is celebrating her freedom, her body and her people the way she wants to be celebrated and depicted,” she continued of her work. “But in the beginning it’s also giving acknowledgment to the ways we were brought here in chains. I am not playing a slave. I’m myself, Nona Faustine, in all of these images.”
The Black body, as a body of work
The Brooklyn Museum’s senior curator Catherine Morris, who organized the show alongside curatorial assistant Carla Forbes, noted the potent double entendre apparent in Faustine’s photographs. Take Faustine’s 2013 picture “From Her Body Came Their Greatest Wealth,” an image in which she stands alone on an apple box in the middle of Wall Street, nude with chains on her arms. Faustine’s stance exudes the confidence of a public orator, Morris explained, while monumentalizing the place where White people sold her ancestors. The photograph illustrates Faustine’s assurance in herself while highlighting the historical tragedies experienced by Black people at the very place she is reclaiming.
As the audience moves through the exhibition and Faustine’s body of work, she becomes more clothed — a symbolic depiction of the movement of time and progression by which Black people gained freedom.
“It is about time travel,” Faustine explained. “When you see me at the end, I’m fully closed and back in the present myself. So I have journeyed through the past and the presents symbolically.”
That journey is gradual: At first, Faustine is seen donning a black and a blue scarf on her head, but no other clothes to cover the rest of her body, in photos taken outside Brooklyn Borough Hall and a playground in Chinatown. In subsequent shoots across Brooklyn and Manhattan, Faustine — still topless, but now wearing a white skirt — holds props like a gun and a sign that quotes Sojourner Truth’s famous speech “Ain’t I A Woman,” honoring those who fought for the abolition of slavery.
And as the exhibition and her photographic journey comes to a close, Faustine wears a white dress and a straw hat, posing with her back facing the audience, in images taken at Shelter Island — where a plantation enslaved Africans and Native Americans from 1651 until 1820 — and Staten Island. In the very final image, she is seen wearing her everyday clothing.

Throughout “White Shoes,” Faustine implores her audience to confront these uncomfortable truths embedded in the very fabric of New York City while honoring the legacies of Black people who were woven into it.
“I want people to understand how far we’ve come. I want them to take pride… I want them to look into the story and know their history,” she said. “This is a history that is being censored and condemned all across the country now.”

How Taiwan’s tallest skyscraper withstands earthquakes
The deadly 7.4 magnitude earthquake that hit Taiwan on Wednesday and left at least 9 people dead, also damaged 770 buildings, according to the latest estimates from the island’s National Fire Agency (NFA).
In the capital Taipei, just 80 miles away from the epicenter, buildings also shook violently during what was Taiwan’s strongest earthquake in 25 years. But in a triumph of modern engineering, the soaring Taipei 101, once the world’s tallest skyscraper, emerged from the island’s latest seismic event undamaged.
Footage from the quake appears to show the 1,667-foot-tall tower slightly swaying, its structural flexibility helping to counter the powerful motion of the quake. This movement perfectly demonstrated how the skyscraper’s single most important defense against earthquakes is the very material it is constructed from: reinforced concrete.
Combining concrete’s compressive strength with steel’s tensile strength, the material makes the building flexible enough to sway, yet rigid enough to resist high winds and the typhoons that frequently hit Taiwan. (The principle that buildings can endure seismic forces by moving with them, rather than against them, has underpinned traditional architecture in earthquake-prone East Asian countries for centuries, from Japanese pagodas to Chinese palaces.)
High within the tower, however, another technological innovation helps protect the 101-story skyscraper — a huge orb-like device known as a tuned mass damper.
Giant counterweight
Suspended from 92 thick cables between the 87th and 92nd floors, the golden steel sphere can move about 5 feet in any direction. As a result, it acts like a pendulum that counteracts (or “dampens”) swaying motions.
“It’s essentially a very large counterweight,” explained Stefan Al, author of “Supertall: How the World’s Tallest Buildings Are Reshaping Our Cities and Our Lives,” in a phone interview. “In the case of Taipei 101, it’s 660 tons. That seems really heavy, but if you compare it to the overall weight of the building, it’s just a fraction.

“When a building starts to shake, (the tuned mass damper) will move in the opposite direction. In the case of Taipei 101, it’s suspended… so it will lag behind as the tower sways and will absorb the kinetic energy by moving in the opposite direction,” Al said, explaining that hydraulic cylinders between the ball and the building convert this energy into heat, which is then dispersed.
Tuned mass dampers are used in skyscrapers around the world, including the “super-skinny” Steinway Tower in New York and Dubai’s sail-shaped Burj al-Arab, which has 11 of them. The device crucially protects against the violent motion caused by “harmonic vibration,” which can cause structural failure during an earthquake, Al said.
“(That’s) when buildings start to vibrate at their own resonance,” he said, comparing the phenomenon to a tuning fork. “This can lead to a collapse, (as the building) will start shaking faster and faster and faster.”
Tuned mass dampers, which are also known as harmonic absorbers, are “tuned” to resonate at the same frequency as the building — but with wavelengths starting earlier or later, helping to dissipate the potentially catastrophic energy.
The stability they provide can also reduce the uncomfortable — or even nauseating — effect swaying can have on a building’s occupants in high winds.

Structural support
Designed by Taiwanese firm C.Y. Lee & Partners, Taipei 101 was the world’s tallest building from 2004 until 2007, when it was surpassed by the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. An observation deck overlooking its groundbreaking tuned mass damper is now a popular visitor attraction, especially when it moves during strong winds.
The giant sphere is not, however, the only design feature helping stabilize the tower, which stands close to a major fault line.
For one, the skyscraper sits on exceptionally deep foundations — namely 380 reinforced concrete and steel piles drilled down into the bedrock below. Above them, the building’s core is connected to a series of “mega-columns,” located around its perimeter, via enormous steel outrigger trusses.

The high-rise complies with strict anti-seismic building codes that are as stringent as one might expect on an island located along the “Pacific Ring of Fire,” which runs around the edge of the Pacific Ocean and causes massive seismic and volcanic activity from Indonesia to Chile.
But while the design also underwent extensive digital modeling and “shake table” testing (in which scale models are tested on a device that replicates the movement of an earthquake), how a building like Taipei 101 would react to a stronger or closer seismic event remains, to an extent, theoretical.
“Even though we have computer simulations, there’s still something about the physical that that we cannot really get from digital simulations,” said Al, adding: “Despite our technological advances, we are still testing (designs) in wind tunnels and shaker tables.”
This article has been updated to reflect the latest estimates on the number of buildings damaged.

Why you should reinstate the classic alarm clock
I have reinstated the alarm clock. An overlooked mechanism in today’s technologically-synced, your-phone-does-everything world, it tells the time, it wakes you up, it is decentralized from a phone. It is marvelous.
Why? Because before I brought an analogue clock back into my bedroom I was averaging two hours and 56 minutes of screen time per week, and my phone told me this every Monday, moments after my alarm would sound.
And, every morning, while only trying to tap “snooze,” I’d be confronted by a flurry of notifications piling up behind one another like a card game of solitaire on the screen. My phone would tell me that my friends were feeling chatty last night with 34-plus Whatsapp messages; there would be Instagram alerts and dozens of emails from multiple accounts. The notifications would fill me with a dread and stress about the day ahead before I’d even had my morning coffee.
I didn’t realize it at the time, but my old analogue clock – a compact, travel model – was a low-key luxury.
Its design would have paled in comparison to the latest iPhones, but it did its one job very well; its punctuating and shrill screech was effective at waking me up every morning. Pertinently, it wasn’t filling my mind with chatter, bad news and deadlines before the day had begun.
Riding the world's most luxurious train with the visionary designer who built it
Changing habits
I made the switch from alarm clock to phone about 10 years ago after I told someone what I thought was a funny story about how my alarm clock had once gone off in my suitcase while in the trunk of a taxi, forcing us to pull over so I could retrieve it. The story provoked bemusement. “You use an actual alarm clock?” they asked, as though it was a fax machine. “Why don’t you use your phone!” Oh, I thought. Why don’t I? I probably didn’t even know I could at the time. But I succumbed to peer pressure and did away with my old clock. And that’s when the luxury of waking up without notifications ended, and the misery of glancing at them in the middle of the night when I checked the time on my phone began.
“The re-introduction of an alarm clock gives me the time, space and separation that my phone didn’t.”
As our use of cell phones continues to grow (a 2018 report by Deloitte found that American smartphone users check their phones 14 billion times a day, up from 9 billion in the same report from 2016), wellness experts say it is having a negative impact our morning routines.
“When you wake up first thing, the ideal is to wake up and spend a little bit of time within your own mind before you’re bombarded with everything else in the world that’s going on. Give yourself a chance to adjust to the waking world,” said mental health and wellbeing coach Lily Silverton. “Historically we’re not used to having our attention taken away as much as it is today.”
Before alarms, it was roosters, church bells, knocker-uppers (people who were paid to wake you up by tapping on the door or window with a long stick, which happened up until the 1970s in industrial Britain) and even our very own bladders that got us out of bed. It is widely thought that the clockmaker Levi Hutchins from Concord, New Hampshire, invented one of the first alarm clocks in 1787. His design would only go off once at 4am, his preferred time to wake. Little appears to be known on the details of the actual design, but he wrote, “It was the idea of a clock that could sound an alarm that was difficult, not the execution of the idea. It was simplicity itself to arrange for the bell to sound at the predetermined hour.” Hutchins never patented or manufactured this clock.
It was years later, in 1874, when the French inventor Antoine Redier became the first person to patent an adjustable mechanical alarm clock. And in 1876, a small mechanical wind-up clock was patented in the US by Seth E. Thomas, which prompted major US clockmakers to start making small alarm clocks. German clockmakers reportedly soon followed and by the end of the 1800s, the electric alarm clock had been invented.
Shopping for clocks
Today, alarm clocks come in any number of designs. From riffs on the Panasonic RC-6025 radio alarm clock, immortalized in the 1993 film Groundhog Day, to more retro designs from classic brands like Roberts. A quick search on Etsy reveals novelty designs in the shape of robots, owls or even rabbits.
Elsewhere, more modern designs include the addition of colour night lights, projectors (to project the time on your ceiling or wall! No, thank you), USB ports speakers, temperature and humidity control, and even teen-proof bed-shakers.
Last year, the late Virgil Abloh’s Off-White label teamed up with Braun to release a pair of sleek limited-edition alarm clocks. In orange and blue, the design is based on the brand’s classic BC02 alarm clock which, strikingly simple, had been originally conceived by Dieter Rams and Dietrich Lubs in the 1980s. Fashion brand Paul Smith, too, released its version of the clock back in 2020.
How innovative design is reshaping the sex tech industry
All I was after, though, was a straightforward alarm clock, much like my original. And I got one from the local homegoods store nearby for £8.50 (just over 10 dollars). The first night I used it, I felt oddly excited as I physically wound the setting as opposed to swiping on a screen. The next morning, in somewhat of an anti-climax, I woke up before the alarm. But I’d already felt like I had conquered the day, instead of chasing it.
According to Silverton, “Technology exploits our psychological weaknesses.” And being connected, she noted, is incredible but terrible at the same time. “It’s managing that and creating a routine that works for you.”
Which now I think I have. The re-introduction of an alarm clock gives me the time, space and separation that my phone didn’t. Even though my phone still sits next to the bed, the difference is it’s no longer the first thing I’m reaching for. My first utterance of the day is no longer blaspheming about an email and feeling my blood boil, I find myself gently considering what I might have for breakfast. Which has given me a sense of control and calm. Bizarrely, it has made me feel younger – I supposed because the experience feels nostalgic, or perhaps because I’m getting better sleep. And what can be more luxurious than that?

Man pleads guilty to theft of solid gold toilet worth $6 million from Blenheim Palace
A man has pleaded guilty to stealing a toilet made entirely from 18-carat gold and worth more than $6 million from the English stately home where wartime leader Winston Churchill was born.
James Sheen, 39, pleaded guilty to burglary, converting or transferring criminal property and conspiracy to do the same at Oxford Crown Court on Tuesday, the UK’s PA Media news agency reported, citing the Crown Prosecution Service.
The fully functioning toilet was installed at Blenheim Palace in 2019 as part of an exhibition by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan called “Victory is Not an Option.”

Four men charged with stealing 18-karat golden toilet worth $6 million
The unusual artwork, titled “America,” was stolen in September 2019 of that year, just days after the exhibition opened. It had been plumbed into the building so the theft also caused significant damage and flooding, police reported at the time.
Sheen appeared at court via video link from Five Wells Prison, where he is serving a 17-year sentence for various thefts. Among others, he is serving time for stealing tractors and high-value trophies from the National Horse Racing Museum in Newmarket, worth a total of £400,000 ($503,000).
“America” first went on display at the Guggenheim in New York City in 2016. It made headlines again in 2017, after US President Donald Trump’s White House emailed the Guggenheim asking to borrow Vincent Van Gogh’s 1888 painting “Landscape with Snow”; instead, the institution’s curator offered the gold toilet.
At Blenheim Palace, the toilet was installed in a room next to the one in which Churchill was born. A statement announcing the exhibition said the work could be perceived as a comment on the social, political and economic disparities in the United States.
Commenting on the work, Cattelan previously told the New Yorker: “Whatever you eat, a two-hundred-dollar lunch or a two-dollar hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise.” He also described the work as “1% art for the 99%.”

The men are due to stand trial in February next year.

Opinion: 6 months since October 7, there are no winners here
Editor’s Note: Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.
Almost exactly six months ago, Israelis awoke to a nightmare. Civilians in the southern part of the country, areas near the border with Gaza, were under a brutal, ongoing attack. It would become the deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust and a prelude to unspeakable suffering on both sides of the border.
Six months after Hamas launched that deadly rampage, knowing that Israel’s response would be ferocious, there are only losers in this terrible war.
It’s hard now to find many winners with the death toll mounting among Gazans and hunger growing in the strip. And with Israeli hostages still held captive, perhaps in dank Hamas tunnels.
For Hamas, the fact that war continues may count as a victory, but thousands of Hamas’ fighters — the exact number is disputed — have been killed. Hamas may be decimated, perhaps unable to hold on to power, but that’s no victory for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is under growing global pressure and besieged by protesters at home, and whose legacy will be forever darkened.

Even US President Joe Biden has paid a price, caught in an election-year political vise between those who think he is too supportive of Israel and those who think he has been too critical.
The strife has also detonated a worldwide explosion of antisemitism, reviving a hatred that had lain lightly dormant. It’s causing anxiety across Europe, and leading some American Jews to conclude that one country where they had felt safe is no longer a haven, as they face antisemitism from the left and the right. Anti-Muslim bigotry has also increased.
This awful chapter started on October 7 last year, when Hamas terrorists breached what was supposed to be a secure border and slaughtered Israelis in their beds, in their living rooms, in their cars, at an outdoor music festival and bus shelters and parks.
They raped countless women with horrifying brutality.
Israeli security forces were nowhere to be found for hours. Hamas — the Iran-allied group that rules Gaza — killed more than 1,200 Israelis and dragged back hundreds more as hostages. The area lay in ruins. Israelis’ sense of security had been shattered.
Today, it is Gaza that lies in ruins, tens of thousands of Palestinians killed by Israel in its quest to uproot and destroy Hamas. As Israel crushes Gaza, its global reputation is getting shattered. But still the IDF believes around 100 Israeli hostages remain captive of Hamas and other militants in conditions that one shudders to imagine.
CNN's Melissa Bell speaks with Yechiel Yehud, the father of two hostages that are still trapped in Gaza. He details his worries, his heartbreak and his hope for the future.

This week’s Israeli strike on a World Central Kitchen (WCK) convoy, killing seven aid workers, adds to the calamity of this convulsion in the perennially unstable crossroads of the Middle East. Amid the outrage and heartbreak, WCK’s founder, celebrity chef José Andrés, accuses Israel of targeting his staff. Israel has apologized, saying the convoy was misidentified. Israel has fired two officers and reprimanded senior commanders after an inquiry into the strike.
There was never any question that Israel would respond to October 7. It had been attacked by a group that promised it would repeat the massacre of Israelis and is backed by Iran, a country whose leaders have vowed to destroy Israel. The attack led some there to conclude that whatever price Israel should pay for absolute victory — including in global public opinion — it is worth paying. Besides, the attackers kidnapped hundreds of its citizens, including women, children and the elderly. Israel needed to save them.
In the immediate aftermath, world leaders expressed support for Israel. But when the death toll in Gaza starting climbing, as Hamas knew it would, international support for Israel turned to withering criticism. In the most painful irony of all, Israel — the country that became home to Holocaust survivors, under attack by a group whose original charter outlined a genocidal ideology and a vow to destroy Israel — was itself perversely accused of genocide.

Biden to Netanyahu: Protect civilians or else
As always, the greatest suffering, the biggest losers, have been civilians on both sides. Palestinians in Gaza are enduring a living nightmare. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 30,000 have been killed in the conflict. The figures don’t distinguish between combatants and civilians, but there’s little doubt that horrifyingly large numbers of them, including children, have been killed. The territory is a wasteland.
Gazans are caught between the cynicism of Hamas, the geopolitical concerns of their Arab neighbors and Israel’s determination to win at any cost. Hamas leaders, comfortable in exile, proclaimed early on that they are “proud to sacrifice martyrs.” Hamas fighters embedded themselves in Gaza’s population, including in hospitals, essentially daring Israel to kill civilians to get to them.
In most wars, civilians would have been allowed to flee the fighting, but the people of Gaza were not allowed to leave the territory whether they wanted to or not. Hamas urged them to stay. Egypt, worried about whether Israel would allow the people to return and concerned about instability on its soil, closed its border to all but a small number of Palestinian civilians.
The cruel fact is that the lives of Palestinians have not been the highest priority for anyone in this war.
Complicating the situation is the political crisis in Israel, which preceded the October 7 attack. Netanyahu — a political survivor who faces corruption charges — already presided over the most right-wing government in Israel’s history. Before the war, tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in nearly 10 months of weekly protests against a plan that would have severely weakened Israeli democracy by stripping the Supreme Court of much of its power.
Netanyahu was, in my view and others’, already the worst prime minister in Israel’s history even before October 7.
Polls have found that most Israelis want him gone. Now Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet but also the leading opposition figure before the war, has called for new elections in September. Recent polling says say he’s Netanyahu’s most likely successor.

Devastation in Gaza as Israel wages war on Hamas
The fact that Netanyahu is heading the government during one of the most dangerous, most damaging times in Israel’s history only adds to the disturbing nature of this conflict. Israel is not in good hands.
Would another leader, a different government, have been able to conduct the war with fewer civilian deaths, with less damage to Israel’s global standing, without eroding the vital relationship between Israel and the United States? I suspect the answer is yes.
If there’s any glimmer of hope in this dispiriting landscape it is that the young Abraham Accords — which normalized relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors — have survived the toughest of stress tests. That augurs well for the long run, for more stability of the region, eventually.
It opens the door to the possibility that once this war is over, once the post-war phase — whatever that looks like — also comes to an end, there could be a new architecture that leads to peace. For that to happen, however, two of the many losing protagonists in this conflict, Hamas and Netanyahu, cannot remain in power.

But when the death toll in Gaza starting climbing, as Hamas knew it would, international support for Israel turned to withering criticism. In the most painful irony of all, Israel — the country that became home to Holocaust survivors, under attack by a group whose original charter outlined a genocidal ideology and a vow to destroy Israel — was itself perversely accused of genocide.

Biden to Netanyahu: Protect civilians or else
As always, the greatest suffering, the biggest losers, have been civilians on both sides. Palestinians in Gaza are enduring a living nightmare. The Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 30,000 have been killed in the conflict. The figures don’t distinguish between combatants and civilians, but there’s little doubt that horrifyingly large numbers of them, including children, have been killed. The territory is a wasteland.
Gazans are caught between the cynicism of Hamas, the geopolitical concerns of their Arab neighbors and Israel’s determination to win at any cost. Hamas leaders, comfortable in exile, proclaimed early on that they are “proud to sacrifice martyrs.” Hamas fighters embedded themselves in Gaza’s population, including in hospitals, essentially daring Israel to kill civilians to get to them.
In most wars, civilians would have been allowed to flee the fighting, but the people of Gaza were not allowed to leave the territory whether they wanted to or not. Hamas urged them to stay. Egypt, worried about whether Israel would allow the people to return and concerned about instability on its soil, closed its border to all but a small number of Palestinian civilians.
The cruel fact is that the lives of Palestinians have not been the highest priority for anyone in this war.
Complicating the situation is the political crisis in Israel, which preceded the October 7 attack. Netanyahu — a political survivor who faces corruption charges — already presided over the most right-wing government in Israel’s history. Before the war, tens of thousands of Israelis took to the streets in nearly 10 months of weekly protests against a plan that would have severely weakened Israeli democracy by stripping the Supreme Court of much of its power.
Netanyahu was, in my view and others’, already the worst prime minister in Israel’s history even before October 7.
Polls have found that most Israelis want him gone. Now Benny Gantz, a member of the war cabinet but also the leading opposition figure before the war, has called for new elections in September. Recent polling says say he’s Netanyahu’s most likely successor.

Devastation in Gaza as Israel wages war on Hamas
The fact that Netanyahu is heading the government during one of the most dangerous, most damaging times in Israel’s history only adds to the disturbing nature of this conflict. Israel is not in good hands.
Would another leader, a different government, have been able to conduct the war with fewer civilian deaths, with less damage to Israel’s global standing, without eroding the vital relationship between Israel and the United States? I suspect the answer is yes.
If there’s any glimmer of hope in this dispiriting landscape it is that the young Abraham Accords — which normalized relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors — have survived the toughest of stress tests. That augurs well for the long run, for more stability of the region, eventually.
It opens the door to the possibility that once this war is over, once the post-war phase — whatever that looks like — also comes to an end, there could be a new architecture that leads to peace. For that to happen, however, two of the many losing protagonists in this conflict, Hamas and Netanyahu, cannot remain in power.

Country music runs deep in the blood of Black folks.
And Beyoncé’s bold, brilliant new album “Act II: Cowboy Carter,” which dropped Friday, is no exception to those musical roots. Instead, it is a continuation, or a reclamation, if you will, of the deep connection that Black Americans have to country music in this country and beyond.
It was from Africa that the banjo, the signature instrument of country music, arrived on our nation’s shores. And from the souls of those enslaved Black people sprang a cacophony of beautiful musical sounds, from gospel, jazz and rhythm and blues to rock, rap and country. Long before there were racially-tinged musical genres created to segregate and monetize music, there was just great music.
If not for the ever-present racism that disrupts and often dictates what spaces Black women can inhabit in society, Beyoncé’s country music album would be no big deal. There’d be no social media backlash, or radio stations refusing to play her music because it just wasn’t country enough. “Cowboy Carter” would be judged solely on its musical merits and everyone would move on.
But that is not the America we live in. And most often, in order to reach our creative and professional best, Black women must resist and work constantly to reclaim our own narratives.

Did Beyoncé reference a Marvel supervillain in her new album? She sure did
By refusing to be musically and culturally contained, Beyonce has given country music a boost that could only have come from one of the world’s top entertainers. Her wildly-successful single from the album, “Texas Hold ‘Em” made Beyoncé the first Black woman to hit number one on the country charts.
And that is why this history-making album is being celebrated.
According to Alice Randall, a country music songwriter and author of “My Black Country,” “Beyoncé has blasted through the intended and not intended boundaries, the cultural redlining.” She told NPR about “Cowboy Carter” that Beyoncé “has ascended to a height no other black women has ascended to in the country. This is a tribute to her own genius and it spotlights the genius that came before.”
Randall is referring to the many great Black country music artists who no doubt led the way for Beyoncé. Country music pioneer Linda Martell intros two songs on the album. Her 1970 album, “Color Me Country,” was the first major release by a Black female artist in country. Martell, now 82, was the first Black woman to perform solo at the Grand Ole Opry, country music’s most important stage located in Nashville, Tennessee.
For a brief time in the 1960s and 1970s, Black country music artists received some commercial success and recognition. Ray Charles’ landmark 1962 album “Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music” topped the charts, The Pointer Sisters’ 1974 hit “Fairytale” won a Grammy for Best Country Vocal Performance, a first for an all-female group.

And Charley Pride, perhaps country music’s most famous Black singer, had 29 number ones on Billboard’s Hot Country Songs chart and more than 50 Top Tens.
It was in 2022 that the Grand Ole Opry issued an apology to the family of late harmonica player DeFord Bailey, one of the most important stars of early country music, for mistreating Bailey and “suppressing the contributions of our diverse community.” Also known as the “Harmonica Wizard,” Bailey was a founding member of the Grand Ole Opry itself. And, though he’s in the Country Music Hall of Fame today, Bailey was never recognized for his countless contributions to the genre.
In my family, music still brings us together across genres, oceans and generations.
Growing up, the stars of our annual family reunion were always a group of cousins in their 80s whose claim to fame in the family was that they had once played at the Grand Ole Opry. We never quite knew if it was just family folklore but what we did know was that when Uncle Wilbur broke out that banjo and his band began picking up their washboards, spoons and harmonicas — it was about to be a backyard throw-down. I still smile when I remember how we all tried to learn how to play spoons. It’s not as easy as it looks.

Country music roots run deep in many Black families like mine, even those of us who never lived “down South.” It will always be the music of our ancestors that still touches our soul and carries us forward, no matter what commercially-acceptable label is forced on the music.
I hear those ancestors in “Cowboy Carter.”
Her song, “Protector,” took me on a beautiful journey back to when my son was first born. I recalled the countless nights I spent, rocking him to sleep to the sounds of Patsy Cline, Ray Charles, Dolly Parton and other favorites.
Bey perfectly captured my feelings as a new mom — full of love and hope for the future. And of the silent vow I made back then to be my child’s protector, shining a light for him as long as I walked this earth.
The best country music will touch our souls by telling stories of regular, everyday lives — our triumphs and our struggles, the breakups and the makeups, the joy and the pain.
And by this measure, I’d say Beyoncé’s second act, “Cowboy Carter,” is indeed classic country music.

Opinion: Half measures won’t work. What Gaza needs is a Marshall Plan
Editor’s Note: Dr. Zaher Sahloul, a pulmonary and critical care specialist, is president of MedGlobal, an NGO that provides medical relief to disaster areas, including Gaza. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
Imagine having to choose between death by starving or by drowning. That is the unspeakably desperate choice that some Gazans have been confronted with in their daily struggle to survive.
Most of us would not choose for one day to live the nightmare that Gazans have experienced for months now, with rudimentary medical care if they are lucky to have any at all, even as infectious disease spreads and as they struggle to survive amid the rubble of bombed out buildings or in open air settlements with tents and tarpaulins as their only shelter.
And with starvation looming, the people of Gaza are reduced to making a desperate scramble for the severely limited food aid that does get through, or to risk their lives trying to collect meals ready to eat (MREs) that the United States and other nations have dropped by air.
Those food drops were purportedly intended to ease the suffering of Gazans. Unfortunately, they are still woefully inadequate to meet the needs of Gazans. In one tragic instance, several people were killed when a pallet bearing food aid plummeted from the sky and landed on top of them.
Last week, the news related to these food drops became even more shocking still, when it was reported that at least a dozen Palestinians perished off the northern Gaza coast while trying to reach airdropped parcels that had landed in the sea.
I’ve been to many war zones in the relief work I’ve carried out over the years with the humanitarian organization that I co-founded, providing emergency response and health programs to vulnerable communities around the world. But in terms of the sheer scale of the misery I have witnessed, there has been nothing to compare to Gaza.
During my two-week mission to Gaza in January, living conditions were already horrific and in the succeeding weeks have gotten much worse. I’ve been appalled by the suffering I have witnessed and like other physicians and aid officials who have been on the ground there, I feel a sense of desperation to get the Biden administration to do everything in its power to bring it to an end.
To that end, I spent a good part of this month in Washington and New York, meeting with lawmakers in Congress, members of the US administration and UN officials, lobbying them to do what they can to bring about a humanitarian ceasefire that will allow Israeli hostages to be released and allow Gazans to receive the food and medical provisions they need. I can’t overstate how urgent it is that the Biden administration negotiate a ceasefire.
But as the situation in Gaza worsens, I’ve become convinced that a ceasefire alone will not be enough to address the deep-rooted challenges created by months of trauma, bombardments and privation. It is imperative for the Biden administration and Congress to approve a substantial aid package for the Palestinians.

Opinion: What Biden needs to know about Rafah
The situation in Gaza necessitates a robust and comprehensive approach akin to the historic Marshall Plan that helped reconstruct a devastated Europe after World War II. But unlike the Marshall Plan that relied almost entirely on American knowhow and resources, this effort to stave off the humanitarian crisis and rebuild Gaza should enlist America’s international partners. Reconstructing the territory will require comprehensive coordination by the US, UN, international NGOs, and supporting countries, and will involve rehabilitating and reconstructing healthcare facilities.
The Biden administration already appears to be aware that the extraordinary challenges in Gaza will require a Herculean, multilateral effort involving nations from around the world. As USAID Administrator Samantha Power said recently in a statement on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, “There must be a continued and sustained international effort to ensure the right type of assistance is getting to the most vulnerable.”
Hospitals and medical facilities, in addition to housing, is where much of this rebuilding effort should begin. Gaza has 36 hospitals, at least 24 of which have shut down because of bombings, forced evacuations, and shortages of supplies. The other dozen are only partially operational.
About half of Gaza’s 2.2 million people are under the age of 18. These children have been forcibly displaced and torn away from their homes, schools and communities. Their experiences are marked by profound loss, as they have witnessed the deaths of their parents, siblings and friends. Undoubtedly, intensive psychological care will need to be part of any program to address the suffering they have endured.
While in Gaza, I observed the triage of trauma patients at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis. After one of the many mass-casualty events that our team witnessed, doctors kneeled on the floor of the bursting emergency department. More than 30 patients were brought in within 10 minutes. Several were dead on arrival.

Opinion: The unimaginable suffering of Gaza’s children
One child, Mohammed Abu Shahla, who I saw die of his injuries, might have survived had there been anything remotely approaching adequate medical care. Mohammed was born in 2011 and had witnessed several wars in his short life. He was displaced with his family and took shelter in a school with a few hundred families which had been considered safe. He was playing near Nasser Hospital, where I was working, when an Israeli missile hit the site. Mohammed suffered brain damage during the blast and never woke up.
The following day at our clinic, I met Lama, a five-year-old from Khan Younis who has been displaced with her family to Rafah. She lives in a storage facility with 16 other displaced people, and is relatively lucky to have any shelter at all as many families are in the streets or live in rudimentary tents. She presented to the clinic with bloody diarrhea. In fact, many children in Gaza have diarrhea due to the lack of clean water and poor sanitation. If this problem persists, there is a severe risk that thousands more young children could die of cholera. The worsening starvation and malnutrition is compounding the problem.
It is incumbent on all of us to make sure that the children in Gaza, like all children on earth, have the right to a better future. Every time I go into a war zone, I ask children: “What would you like to be when you grow up?” I mean with this question to imply my hope — and silent prayer — that they will indeed grow up to fulfill their most fervent dreams and perhaps to have children of their own.

One school I visited in Rafah had been repurposed as a displacement center, and was overwhelmed by an influx of children suffering from skin conditions resulting from poor hygiene, as well as frequent outbreaks of diarrhea and hepatitis. There, in an overcrowded classroom, I met a 12-year-old named Abdallah.
When I asked about his aspirations for the future, the boy mumbled: “What future?” The extent of unspoken trauma was evident on his face and echoed by his words. How long will it take to heal the hidden wounds of those who are lucky enough to survive?
Still, there is hope. A majority of the children I met told me, in fact, that they hoped to practice medicine when they grow up. Perhaps that career choice is not entirely surprising, given the magnitude of the grievous bodily injuries many will have seen, and their understanding that there are inadequate medical resources to cope with them.
But there’s another possible reason why, amid the chaos and suffering, so many of Gaza’s children dare to dream of the future: The territory boasts some of the highest education rates in the region, with a literacy rate prior to the start of the war of 97.7%, according to UN statistics. Many of these children would likely have been on paths that might have led them to professions in medicine and other fields, probably in service to their community.
Gaza’s children might still have the ability to nurture those dreams. But the international community will need to construct homes, businesses, hospitals and other facilities that they desperately need before Gazans are able to reconstruct their lives.

Opinion: 25 years later, ‘The Matrix’ is less sci-fi than tech reality
Editor’s Note: Rizwan Virk, who founded Play Labs @ MIT, is the author of “The Simulation Hypothesis: An MIT Computer Scientist Shows Why AI, Quantum Physics and Eastern Mystics Agree We Are in a Video Game” and “The Simulated Multiverse.” He is currently at Arizona State University’s College of Global Futures in the Center for Science and the Imagination. Follow him on X @rizstanford, on Instagram @rizcambridge and at zenentrepreneur.com. The views expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.
It’s been 25 years since the release of the blockbuster film “The Matrix,” created by Lana and Lilly Wachowski (credited in the film as the Wachowski brothers), which popularized the idea that we might already be inside a computer-generated video game world.
“The Matrix,” released March 31, 1999, wasn’t the most anticipated film of the final year of the 20th century (that would probably have been “Star Wars: Episode 1 — The Phantom Menace”), but it inevitably became the most talked-about film that year and one we’re still talking about today.
The film’s buzz was partly because of its groundbreaking special effects (like bullet time), but the movie has remained relevant because of our ongoing angst with artificial intelligence (AI) and the core techno-philosophical question of the film that is now asked regularly: Are we living inside a computer simulation?
In the decades since, this idea, now called the simulation hypothesis, has come to be taken more seriously by technologists, scientists and philosophers. The main reason for this shift is the stunning improvements in computer graphics, virtual and augmented reality (VR and AR) and AI. Taking into account three developments just this year from Apple, Neuralink and OpenAI, I can now confidently state that as you are reading this article, you are more likely than not already inside a computer simulation. This is because the closer our technology gets to being able to build a fully interactive simulation like the Matrix, the more likely it is that someone has already built such a world, and we are simply inside their video game world.

Opinion: The next time I want to see Timothée Chalamet, I’ll do it from the comfort of my couch
At the time of the film’s release, this idea of being inside a video game was firmly in the realm of science fiction. It had been articulated by one of the Wachowskis’ heroes, science fiction author Philip K. Dick, who stated, all the way back in 1977, “We are living in a computer programmed reality.”
A few years ago, I interviewed Dick’s wife Tessa and asked her what he would have thought of “The Matrix.” She said his first reaction would have been that he loved it; however, his second reaction would most likely have been to call his agent to see if he could sue the filmmakers for stealing his ideas.
When the film came out, the World Wide Web was relatively new and AI was still in development, but underneath the techno-optimism of the dot-com boom, we were already feeling anxiety about where the technology would take us. Much like “The Terminator” in the 1980s, when personal computers (without internet connections) were all the rage, “The Matrix” tapped into nascent fears of being connected all the time via cyberspace.
I watched the movie again recently for my college-level class about simulation theory, where I use “The Matrix” as a vehicle to ask questions about philosophy, science, AI, technology and religion. The movie still resonates with today’s younger generation, many of whom grew up on multiplayer online games like Fortnite and Roblox. Most also now use AI tools like ChatGPT on a daily basis and have few qualms about doing so.
Given that AI is now in the news every day, “The Matrix” is more relevant than ever. In one notable scene in the film, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) tells Neo (Keanu Reeves) that he is trapped in a simulation of 1999; the real year is around 2199. Morpheus explains that sometime in the early 21st century, AI became conscious and there was a war between humans and AI.
The most famous sequence in the film starts with Morpheus asking Neo, who wants to know what the Matrix is, whether he will take the red pill and be “woken up” or if he will take the blue pill and return to blissful ignorance living in the simulated world of 1999.

Opinion: The character I missed most while watching ‘Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire’
Twenty-five years later, the term “red pill” has been coopted and overused to mean that someone is waking up to deception by the powers that be. Still, this sequence, which ends with Neo waking up in a futuristic world where humans are enslaved by AI, inspired many to  consider whether we, too, were living in a simulation.
I began to wonder this myself when I first played a VR ping-pong game that was so realistic that I tried to put the non-existent paddle down on the non-existent table. I speculated on how long it would take us to reach the simulation point, a kind of technological singularity that would mark our ability to create AI-generated virtual worlds that are indistinguishable from the physical world.
The closer we get to this point, the chances that we are already inside a simulation go up rapidly. In 2003, Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom imagined a “technologically mature” civilization could easily create a simulated world. The logic, then, is that if any civilization ever reaches this point, it would create not just one but a very large number of simulations (perhaps billions), each with billions of AI characters, simply by firing up more servers.
With simulated worlds far outnumbering the “real” world, the likelihood that we are in a simulation would be significantly higher than not. It was this logic that prompted Elon Musk to state, a few years ago, that the chances that we are not in a simulation (i.e. that we are in base reality) was “one in billions.”
It’s a theory that is difficult to prove — but difficult to disprove as well. Remember, the simulations would be so good that you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference between a physical and a simulated world. Either the signals are being beamed directly into your brain, or we are simply AI characters inside the simulation.

Opinion: Kristen Stewart’s portrayal of queerness and family is a sharp reminder
Think of either Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who represented one of many “programs” or AI characters, or characters like Neo and Trinity (Carrie Ann-Moss), who existed outside of the Matrix and had digital representations (called avatars today) inside the simulation.
Recent developments in Silicon Valley show that we could get to the simulation point very soon. Just this year, Apple released its Vision Pro headset — a mixed-reality (including augmented and virtual reality) device that, if you believe initial reviews (ranging from mildly positive to ecstatic), heralds the beginning of a new era of spatial computing — or the merging of digital and physical worlds.
The headset can make you believe you are in another time and place, but more importantly, it can overlay realistic-looking objects in the room around you, blurring the line between physical and digital objects. The headset is still expensive (it retails for $3,500) and bulky compared to headsets in science fiction (like in “Westworld,” “Ready Player One” or “3 Body Problem”), but we can see a direct line to being able to render a realistic fictional world around us.
But what if you didn’t need a headset at all? Earlier this year, Musk announced the first human implant of a brain chip from his company, Neuralink. While previous Neuralink demos have shown promise by implanting chips in and reading the brainwaves of a pig and a monkey, the current human clinical trials show that a quadriplegic man can play video games using his mind.
Though nascent, we can see a clear path to future technology that might send signals into the brain, reminiscent of the sci-fi neural interfaces used by Neo and Morpheus in “The Matrix.”

Opinion: Eleanor Roosevelt’s prescient grasp of AI
Finally, the driving force in Silicon Valley over the past few years has been the rapid development of artificial intelligence in the form of products like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini to DALL-E and Midjourney.
The rapid pace at which AI is developing has led to warnings of an AI apocalypse, with thousands of scientists and technologists demanding a pause in research. One prominent AI researcher even promoted the possibility of bombing rogue AI data centers.
In “The Matrix,” Morpheus explains to Neo that the physical world is a wasteland, not because of AI, but because of the war between AI and humans. It was the humans who scorched the planet in the hopes of shutting down AI by cutting off their access to solar power. The AI had a clever solution: It was able to create realistic-enough simulations that humans could be fooled into believing they were in the real world.
Is this really feasible? Just last month, OpenAI released Sora AI, which can now generate highly realistic videos that are pretty damn difficult to distinguish from real human videos.
The fact that AI can so easily fool humans visually as well as through text (and according to some, has already passed the well-known Turing Test) shows that we are not far from fully immersive worlds populated with simulated AI characters that seem (and perhaps even think they are) conscious. Already, millions of humans are chatting with AI characters, and millions of dollars are pouring into making AI characters more realistic. Some of us may be players of the game, who have forgotten that we allowed the signal to be beamed into our brain, while others, like Neo or Morpheus or Trinity in “The Matrix,” may have been plugged in at birth.

Remember that in a realistic simulation, unlike in the film, most of the characters in the simulation would be AI characters, or NPCs (a common term in video games that stands for “non-player characters”), thinking they are conscious and living in a real world. Think of the training simulation that Neo gets plugged into which has a woman in red and millions of NPCs roaming the simulated world, not aware of what, who or where they are.
Rewatching “The Matrix” today will most likely make you look around and ask, as Neo did, “You mean this isn’t real?” On the 25th anniversary of this mind-blowing film, I can answer that it’s probably not real. The fact that we are approaching the simulation point so soon in our future means that the likelihood that we are already inside someone else’s advanced simulation goes up exponentially. Like Neo, we would be unable to tell the difference between a simulated and a physical world. Perhaps the most appropriate response to that is another of Reeves’ most famous lines from that now-classic sci-fi film: Woah.

Opinion: Why I’m resigning from the State Department
Editor’s Note: Annelle Sheline, PhD, served for a year as a foreign affairs officer at the Office of Near Eastern Affairs in the Department of State’s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. The views expressed here are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.
Since Hamas’ attack on October 7, Israel has used American bombs in its war in Gaza, which has killed more than 32,000 people — 13,000 of them children — with countless others buried under the rubble, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health. Israel is credibly accused of starving the 2 million people who remain, according to the UN special rapporteur on the right to food; a group of charity leaders warns that without adequate aid, hundreds of thousands more will soon likely join the dead.
Yet Israel is still planning to invade Rafah, where the majority of people in Gaza have fled; UN officials have described the carnage that is expected to ensue as “beyond imagination.” In the West Bank, armed settlers and Israeli soldiers have killed Palestinians, including US citizens. These actions, which experts on genocide﻿  have testified meet the crime of genocide, are conducted with the diplomatic and military support of the US government.
For the past year, I worked for the office devoted to promoting human rights in the Middle East. I believe strongly in the mission and in the important work of that office. However, as a representative of a government that is directly enabling what the International Court of Justice has said could plausibly be a genocide in Gaza, such work has become almost impossible. Unable to serve an administration that enables such atrocities, I have decided to resign from my position at the Department of State.
Whatever credibility the United States had as an advocate for human rights has almost entirely vanished since the war began. Members of civil society have refused to respond to my efforts to contact them. Our office seeks to support journalists in the Middle East; yet when asked by NGOs if the US can help when Palestinian journalists are detained or killed in Gaza, I was disappointed that my government didn’t do more to protect them. Ninety Palestinian journalists in Gaza have been killed in the last five months, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. That is the most recorded in any single conflict since the CPJ started collecting data in 1992.
By resigning publicly, I am saddened by the knowledge that I likely foreclose a future at the State Department. I had not initially planned a public resignation. Because my time at State had been so short — I was hired on a two-year contract — I did not think I mattered enough to announce my resignation publicly. However, when I started to tell colleagues of my decision to resign, the response I heard repeatedly was, “Please speak for us.”

Opinion: What Biden needs to know about Rafah
Across the federal government, employees like me have tried for months to influence policy, both internally and, when that failed, publicly. My colleagues and I watched in horror as this administration delivered thousands of precision-guided munitions, bombs, small arms and other lethal aid to Israel and authorized thousands more, even bypassing Congress to do so. We are appalled by the administration’s flagrant disregard for American laws that prohibit the US from providing assistance to foreign militaries that engage in gross human rights violations or that restrict the delivery of humanitarian aid.
The Biden administration’s own policy states, “The legitimacy of and public support for arms transfers among the populations of both the United States and recipient nations depends on the protection of civilians from harm, and the United States distinguishes itself from other potential sources of arms transfers by elevating the importance of protecting civilians.” Yet this noble statement of policy has been directly in contradiction with the actions of the president who promulgated it.
President Joe Biden himself indirectly admits that Israel is not protecting Palestinian civilians from harm. Under pressure from some congressional Democrats, the administration issued a new policy to ensure that foreign military transfers don’t violate relevant domestic and international laws.
Yet just recently, the State Department ascertained that Israel is in compliance with international law in the conduct of the war and in providing humanitarian assistance. To say this when Israel is preventing the adequate entrance of humanitarian aid and the US is being forced to air drop food to starving Gazans, this finding makes a mockery of the administration’s claims to care about the law or about the fate of innocent Palestinians.

Opinion: The crux of Israel’s challenge
Some have argued that the US lacks influence over Israel. Yet Retired Israeli Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Brick noted in November that Israel’s missiles, bombs and airplanes all come from the US. “The minute they turn off the tap, you can’t keep fighting,” he said. “Everyone understands that we can’t fight this war without the United States. Period.”
Even now, Israel is considering invading Lebanon, which brings a heightened risk of regional conflict that would be catastrophic. The US has sought to prevent this outcome but shows no appetite for withholding offensive weapons from Israel in order to compel greater restraint there or in Gaza. Biden’s support for Israel’s far-right government thus risks sparking a wider conflagration in the region, which could well put US troops in harm’s way.
So many of my colleagues feel betrayed. I write for myself but speak for many others, including Feds United for Peace, a group mobilizing for a permanent ceasefire in Gaza that represents federal workers in their personal capacities across the country, and across 30 federal agencies and departments. After four years of then-President Donald Trump’s efforts to cripple the department, State employees embraced Biden’s pledge to rebuild American diplomacy. For some, US support for Ukraine against Russia’s illegal occupation and bombardment seemed to reestablish America’s moral leadership. Yet the administration continues to enable Israel’s illegal occupation and destruction of Gaza.

I am haunted by the final social media post of Aaron Bushnell, the 25-year-old US Air Force serviceman who self-immolated in front of the Israeli Embassy in Washington on February 25: “Many of us like to ask ourselves, ‘What would I do if I was alive during slavery? Or the Jim Crow South? Or apartheid? What would I do if my country was committing genocide?’ The answer is, you’re doing it. Right now.”
I can no longer continue what I was doing. I hope that my resignation can contribute to the many efforts to push the administration to withdraw support for Israel’s war, for the sake of the 2 million Palestinians whose lives are at risk and for the sake of America’s moral standing in the world.

Opinion: The long overdue death of the stick shift car
Editor’s Note: Paul Hockenos is a Berlin-based writer focusing on renewable energy in Europe. He is the author of four books on European issues, most recently “Berlin Calling: A Story of Anarchy, Music, the Wall and the Birth of the New Berlin.” The opinions in this article are those of the author. View more opinion on CNN.
For old-school connoisseurs of the automobile — usually men — driving means operating a beloved vehicle by touch, with three pedals underfoot and a shift stick at hand.
In Europe, this clientele is responsible for a good deal of the moaning about manual transmission’s demise. And perhaps nowhere is it louder than in Germany, the home of Porsche, BMW, Volkswagen and Mercedes Benz.
Take for example the German automotive writer for the Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung who waxed melancholy in a heartfelt “homage to the good old days of the clutch and gear stick.”
“What could be a greater pleasure… than tooling along winding roads in a sports car at high speeds? Accelerate, downshift before the bend, turn in, roll, upshift again, and ‘fly away,’” he wrote.
He affectionately describes the stick shift’s smooth knob nestled in his palm. (Sigmund Freud would have had no trouble deducing the grounds for this allure.)
They feel there’s something authentic about it: a connection between driver and vehicle that automatization cuts out.
Paul Hockenos
But it’s not just Europeans (literally) clinging on. In the US, there’s apparently a young (also predominantly male) demographic that is embracing manual driving — championing it as retro, much like Gen Z’s affinity to typewriters and vintage cameras. They feel there’s something authentic about it: a connection between driver and vehicle that automatization cuts out.
They may not know it, but both these European connoisseurs and young Americans are of a mind with Robert M. Pirsig’s protagonist in his classic 1970s philosophical novel, “Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,” who feels at one with his motorbike because he understands how it functions. Just pushing a button is a superficial copout.
Well, Zen or not, the day of manual transmissions is speeding to an end — and this layman is shedding no tears.
It’s not just that I cringe at the grating screech of a botched downshift, that high-pitched sequel worse than fingernails across a chalkboard. The sound upbraids and shames me for having wronged the drivetrain. But this obviously never happens to alpha men, the kind who love their engines and coax them to purr.
The superfluous clutch
Today, however, there are knockout reasons — beyond the transmission’s wellbeing — for the end of the stick shift era, and why we should applaud it, too.
For one, the oft-repeated benefits of a stick shift over an automatic have been redundant now for years.
Twentieth century wisdom was that because manuals had more gears than automatics — the latter usually just three — an adroit shifter with five on the floor could operate the engine more efficiently, and thus get more miles to the tankful.

But technology has moved on and automatics with as many as nine gears are common. And they chalk up better mileage and drive faster than their stick-shift counterparts. The explanation: automatics select the right gear for the vehicle, usually the highest gear possible. The average manual driver is not always so proficient. In getting the gear right, automatics consume less fuel, save money and emit fewer emissions.
These are among the reasons why it’s ever harder to buy a new manual-transmission model of any kind in many countries. In the US, less than 1% of new models have stick shifts (compared to 35% in 1980), according to the Environmental Protection Agency. It’s really only sports cars, off-road truck SUVs and a handful of small pickups that still have clutches.
In Europe, Volkswagen is dropping all of its manual-gearbox vehicles in order to comply with EU regulations to reduce emissions.
Gearboxes as such are out
While all gasoline-run cars and trucks are climate killers with stick shifts being the slightly worse of two evils, combustion-engine automatics themselves are on their way out. They are tooling along the highway side-by-side with their stick-and-clutch counterparts toward the junkyard of history.

Opinion: Why EVs are suddenly controversial
Electric vehicles have gear systems, too: a single speed transmission that transmits energy from the motor to the wheels. But because only one gear exists, there is no switching of gears, neither automatically nor manually.
For the gear-shifting self-appointed connoisseurs, the EVs’ whoosh to higher speeds probably irks them even more than automatics. But fossil-fuel-burning engines of all kinds are on their way out — as a result of the climate crisis — and the sooner we’re rid of them, the better.
Road transportation accounts for 15% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, according to Our World Data, as well as being a huge contributor to the air pollution that claims around nine million deaths a year from respiratory and lung diseases. Transportation noise, though less deadly, also contributes to stress and sleep disorders.
EVs to the rescue
Thankfully, there’s a convenient way to circumvent these blights: electric vehicles.
Last year, the sales of electrics tripled over the proceeding three years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). It added that if the trend continues — which hinges upon the rollout of charging stations — the EV revolution will save the planet five million barrels of oil a day by 2030.

Positive surveys seem to jibe with my own and friends’ impressions of the ride one gets with the EV. It’s quiet and as smooth as crème brulee. “My husband and I actually fight over who’s going to drive the EV to work,” my friend Cristine in upstate New York told me. And my brother in San Francisco is into his fourth year of leasing an EV.
In cities like Oslo, Norway, where new EV sales are the rule rather than the exception, the air is cleaner, noise is less and overall emissions are down, too. So successful has the electric push been, Norway is ending the sale of gasoline cars in 2025.
But for those aficionados who really can’t go without a clutch and gear shifter, Toyota is planning a realistic-feeling fake manual transmission for some EV models.
It serves no purpose whatsoever — save to comfort bruised egos.

A Situation Room scramble, daily calls and political intrigue: Inside the White House response to the Key Bridge collapse
Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had been preparing to rise early for a flight to out west, where he would conduct a weeklong swing with local officials and the highway administrator in Wyoming and Montana.
But when the Dali container ship sailing through the Patapsco River made a “mayday” call just before 1:30 a.m. ET, overnight staffers in the White House Situation Room began frantically reaching out to senior officials to notify them of the collision – and collapse – of Baltimore’s Francis Scott Key Bridge.
The US Coast Guard, which has a robust presence along the eastern seaboard, was onsite within minutes. And then Buttigieg started working the phones himself.
“By the time I got a hold of the (Maryland) governor, he was wide awake and hard to work and clearly had been for some time,” Buttigieg told CNN. A DOT call log shows the two spoke at 4:34 a.m ET.
By 5 a.m. ET, Buttigieg had already spoken with Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and White House chief of staff Jeff Zients – all trying to figure out how to marshal federal resources to begin, first, a search and rescue operation and, eventually, a massive economic rebuild.
Jen Daskal, the deputy homeland security adviser, began preparing a briefing for President Joe Biden. Two Oval Office meetings were convened as staff at various levels began trickling into the White House.
“He wanted to know basic facts about what happened,” said a senior administration official familiar with the discussions. “What we knew about the cause, how many people were unaccounted for, and to ensure that all the federal resources were being brought to bear.”
Once the President had a firm grasp on the situation, he began reaching out to state and local leaders directly. During one – a 10-minute call with Baltimore County executive Johnny Olszewski – Biden discussed the port’s meaning him from his days commuting from Washington to Delaware.
“He demonstrated a clear understanding of the importance of the port, had a real empathy for myself and all the individuals impacted,” Olszewski told CNN. “And he was unequivocal that he was going to do whatever he can, legally and within his power to expedite a response.”
The president spent much of Friday afternoon in Baltimore, doing an aerial tour of the collapse and being briefed on response efforts from the unified command in charge of the work. He will also meet with loved ones of the six people killed during the collapse.
During a speech overlooking the river, Biden mourned the dead.
“I’ve come here to grieve with you – we all are,” he said.
“We’re gonna move heaven and earth to rebuild this bridge as rapidly as humanly possible, and we’re going to do so with union labor and American steel,” Biden added. “My administration is committed – absolutely committed – to ensuring that the parties responsible for this tragedy pay to repair the damage and be held accountable to the fullest extent the law will allow. But we also want to be clear, we will support Maryland and Baltimore every step of the way, to help you rebuild and maintain all the business and commerce.”
Biden promises federal support ahead of a long recovery
Hours after the collapse, Biden spoke about the collapse publicly, pledging the federal government would cover the entire cost of the rebuild as he detailed what was known at that point about the incident. The pledge to cover the rebuild was personal, Buttigieg said.
“That came directly from him,” said Buttigieg, who had arrived in Baltimore by the time Biden delivered those remarks.
The Coast Guard by midday had stood up a unified command that in the days that followed would procure the largest crane barge in the eastern seaboard to the Patapsco River to begin salvage operations. Seven barges and nine tugboats have deployed to the area, according to Tom Perez, the White House director of intergovernmental affairs.
“We’re all rowing in synchrony,” Perez tells CNN.
By March 28, the state of Maryland notified the government that it intended to request $60 million in funding for the first phase of recovery.
After receiving the official funding request on March 29, the Department of Transportation authorized the money in less than four hours - which officials there say is a record.
Perez said $60 million is “an ample amount to address the immediate needs,” but the government will provide more as needed – a relief to local officials as they begin to estimate a project that is expected to require billions of dollars over multiple years.
“It’s just been very reassuring to hear both President Biden and Secretary Buttigieg early consistently reinforce the point that the federal government will be there to be covering costs,” said Olszewski. “Not having to worry about the funding is really important.”
Nearly two weeks after the tragedy, the government’s response has evolved from triage to periodic check-ins. Federal and local officials now speak closer to every day instead of every hour. Processes to help the families of the victims seek closure through immigration services are underway, and they will still take weeks to put into effect.
“Now, we’ve got to set up a pattern that works for the long run, you know, long past the salvage and emergency response phase,” Buttigieg said.
Some patterns are already taking shape. Natalie Quillian, White House deputy chief of staff, currently leads a call each afternoon among the agencies and officials involved, where they discuss the progress made that day and the marching orders for the next.
“To have that direct line to folks who are at the highest levels responsible for coordinating the response at the federal level?” Olszewski said. “I think that that can’t be understated.”
Checking their egos at the door
Of course, the officials involved are all political personalities in their own right: Buttigieg, a former presidential candidate; Moore, an oft-rumored future presidential candidate; Perez, the former party chief and onetime candidate for Maryland governor; and then, the sitting president of the United States himself.
Perez says what they all share the “North Star” of wanting to help people, and they’ve all “checked their egos at the door.”
But they also all conveniently share a party affiliation – and overlapping policy agendas as a result – and acknowledge that that detail helps foam the runway.
“When you have those built-in relationships, people know that you’re operating in good faith,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, who visits the White House regularly for work on public safety and gun control. “It makes working together in a tragedy easier.
Administration officials have taken note during appearances by Buttigieg and Moore of potential foreshadowing to 2028, when one or both could run for president. In another case – that of Moore and Perez – the two have already opposed each other on the ballot.
Perez ran for the Democratic nomination for governor in 2022 and was defeated by Moore. But he says that’s water under the bridge.
“Yes, we ran against each other, but that’s yesterday’s news,” Perez says. “We’re all about governing.”

Melania Trump set to appear at fundraiser for Log Cabin Republicans at Mar-a-Lago
Former first lady Melania Trump is set to appear at a fundraiser for the Log Cabin Republicans, according to a source familiar with the event.
The fundraiser for the conservative LGBTQ group will be held on April 20 at Mar-a-Lago. The former first lady has taken part in events with the Log Cabin Republicans since leaving the White House. In 2021, she was the guest of honor at the group’s annual Spirit of Lincoln Gala.
Melania Trump has largely remained absent from the campaign trail, making only two formal public appearances for her husband’s White House bid – the November 2022 kickoff for former President Donald Trump’s campaign and an appearance with him in March to vote in the Florida presidential primary.
Asked by a reporter in Palm Beach after casting her ballot if she would be returning to the campaign trail, Melanie Trump said, “Stay tuned.”
The event with the Log Cabin Republicans, though, is expected to be largely behind closed doors and will likely still keep her out of the public eye.
Politico was first to report on Trump’s involvement with the fundraiser for the Log Cabin Republicans.
As CNN previously reported, how frequently the former first lady will hit the campaign trail this year is entirely in her hands.

“She is very selective and methodical in what she wants to do and how she presents herself,” a source close to the former president said in late March. “She is very decisive with these things and knows they have a lot of intended and unintended consequences.”
Donald Trump has teased before that there is some allure to the intrigue over his wife’s whereabouts on the trail.
“I think part of the beauty is that mystery,” the former president told Megyn Kelly on her podcast last year. “She’s introspective and she’s confident, she doesn’t need to be interviewed by you to get ripped apart for no reason. She doesn’t need to be out there. She’s got confidence, she has a lot of self-confidence.”

John Eastman wants to keep practicing law, representing Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene – and paying his own bills
Former Trump attorney John Eastman is trying to get his law license back so that he can represent Reps. Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene in a political speech fight – and pay his own legal bills as he fights charges stemming from his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
Eastman is asking a judge in California to reactivate his license following a disciplinary decision last month that rendered him unable to practice law for now.
According to a court filing this week, Eastman estimates he already owes more than $1 million to his lawyers and could face a bill of more than $3 million “even if he is fully exonerated” in the Georgia election subversion case. He is one of 15 remaining defendants, including former President Donald Trump. A trial isn’t yet scheduled.
The filing provides a rare window into the growing legal costs for Trump’s allies and into the scope of Eastman’s legal work since he promoted false information about the 2020 vote and tried to persuade then-Vice President Mike Pence to block the presidential transfer of power from Trump to Joe Biden.
The fallout Eastman faces from his 2020 election work was compounded last week, when Judge Yvette Roland, who serves as a judge overseeing state bar proceedings in California, decided he should be disbarred because of his court filings and other efforts on behalf of Trump.
That decision prompted his law license to be made inactive over the weekend, meaning he can’t have legal clients while he appeals the decision. Disbarment would ultimately have to be affirmed by the California Supreme Court.
“If the Order placing Dr. Eastman on inactive enrollment were not stayed, Dr. Eastman would lose his ability to make a living as an attorney at a time when other matters arising out of his representation of the former President of the United States … have already caused him to incur more than $1 million in legal fees,” his attorneys wrote in his request this week to the judge in California.
“The loss of income from the practice of law in the face of such necessity would be highly prejudicial to Dr. Eastman’s ability to defend himself in Fulton County,” they wrote.
Eastman says his legal fees could increase to $3 million or more as he faces a criminal trial in Fulton County, Georgia, in the state-level conspiracy case alongside Trump related to the 2020 election.
Eastman also told the judge he no longer represents Trump in election challenges, thus is no longer a threat to the public or his client.
To pay his legal fees, Eastman has continued to work as a lawyer after the 2020 election — picking up influential clients such as Republicans Gaetz and Greene as well as the Republican Party of Colorado in various lawsuits.
Until his law license was made inactive, Eastman represented about a half-dozen clients on constitutional issues, including relating to elections.
He represented the Colorado Republican Party in a challenge to the state’s open primaries. He also represented Gaetz and Greene in their lawsuit against local officials who cancelled their political rallies in Anaheim and Riverside, California, in 2021. A federal judge has allowed their lawsuit to move forward, after the cities attempted to have it dismissed.
Eastman also regularly pens Supreme Court amicus briefs for conservative-leaning groups.
Those prominent clients are now going to bat for him in his request to continue his legal work. The clients know of Eastman’s disciplinary fallout with the bar in California and still want him to represent them, according to a sworn statement Eastman provided to the judge.
“I write today to urge you to enable him to continue to represent me in that matter, so as not to compound one First Amendment violation with another. I have a right to the counsel of my choice, and I know there is no other competent, qualified attorney whom I can trust in this matter,” Gaetz wrote in a letter to the State Bar of California.
Greene’s campaign committee and the joint fundraising committee “Put America First” have paid Eastman’s law partnership about $25,000 for legal services since 2021, according to campaign finance records.
Eastman’s other clients also have filed sworn statements to the California judge saying they’d like him to still represent them, including the mother of a middle schooler whom Eastman now represents in a First Amendment lawsuit, after the child was asked to leave his middle school for bringing a backpack with patches on it that included the “Don’t tread on me” Gadsden flag, according to the court filings.
The disciplinary judge hasn’t yet ruled on Eastman’s request, and the California bar disciplinary prosecutor has more than a week to respond.

Exclusive: State Department officials told House investigators they created Afghanistan withdrawal plans from scratch
Hours of closed-door testimony from three top State Department officials shed new light on the “unprecedented” situation in the final days of the US presence in Afghanistan as the officials were rushed to the country with virtually no time to prepare and no established emergency evacuation plan in place when they arrived.
The three officials, John Bass, Jim DeHart and Jayne Howell, were all plucked from unrelated assignments and rushed into Afghanistan in the hours after Kabul fell to the Taliban due to their extensive experience in Afghanistan.
The transcripts of their interviews with the House Foreign Affairs Committee, obtained exclusively by CNN, are the latest tranche of more than a dozen interviews conducted by the committee as a key part of Republican Chairman Michael McCaul’s ongoing investigation into the 2021 evacuation that involved the deaths of 13 US service members.
McCaul is planning to put out a report later this year that includes overall takeaways from the interviews, as well as State Department notes the House Foreign Affairs Committee has received from the agency’s own review of the withdrawal. Biden administration officials expect that the report will be timed with a political motive: to bring the Afghanistan withdrawal back to the fore during the heat of the presidential election.
The new details paint a picture of the chaos outside the Kabul airport and the ad-hoc nature of the evacuation, something that top US military generals suggested could have been mitigated if the State Department had called sooner for a “noncombatant evacuation operation” – known as a NEO – for remaining US citizens in Afghanistan.
“It is my assessment that that decision came too late,” Gen. Mark Milley, the now-retired Joint Chiefs chairman, said at the House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing last month. The State Department has continued to publicly defend its decision making around the NEO as well as the ending of the war.

Top generals who oversaw US withdrawal from Afghanistan slam State Department for delaying emergency evacuation
A State Department spokesperson, asked about the interviews, said that “each of the current and former Department officials interviewed by the Committee worked alongside thousands of other personnel from the Department and the military to evacuate nearly 124,000 U.S. citizens, Afghan allies, and international partners, a massive and extremely challenging military, diplomatic, and humanitarian undertaking conducted under extraordinary circumstances.”
“It was the right decision to end the 20-year war in Afghanistan, the longest war in American history, and bring our troops home,” the State Department spokesperson told CNN Wednesday. “That decision has allowed the U.S. to better address the foreign policy challenges of the present and future, including the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East.”
No working evacuation plan in place
All three of the officials rushed to Kabul in the days surrounding the Taliban’s seizure of the capital city, and dove into creating systems on the fly alongside the US military and with constantly-changing input on the ground and coming from DC.
Though officials who had worked at the embassy leading up to the evacuation told the committee investigators in separate interviews that planning for a NEO began in April or May, the officials who arrived in August said that no such clearly articulated plan served as their guide.
“I cannot emphasize enough to you that minute to minute, what was happening was changing,” Howell said in her July 2023 interview.
Every single US embassy around the world is required to have a NEO that can be used in the case of emergency evacuation situations, but the officials explained that the dangerous and over-crowded Kabul airport environment would have rendered any preformed plans ineffective and instead forced them to constantly adapt.
DeHart said they had to “create from scratch tactical operations that would get our priority people into the airport.” He added: “we were roughly as effective as we could be under the circumstances.”
Bass, who served as the top State Department coordinator on the evacuation efforts on the ground, echoed those sentiments.
“We were already in the midst of executing an evacuation that substantially exceeded I think the scope and scale of what had been contemplated,” explained Bass.
There was no time for them to prepare before landing in Afghanistan. Bass was serving at the Foreign Service Institute when he said he was asked to take up the role by then-Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman, and he departed eight to ten hours later. DeHart, who worked as Bass’ deputy, left from his posting as coordinator for arctic affairs in Washington. Howell, who served as senior consular officer on the ground, traveled to Afghanistan directly from her posting in Turkey.
The officials had virtually no briefings ahead of their arrival. Bass said in his January 2024 testimony that “given how fluid the situation was on the ground, I’m not sure that additional preparation time would have yielded a significant benefit.”
But the weighty challenge was overwhelming for the consular officers, who vetted the people seeking to leave on US flights. They faced constantly changing directions in terms of who could be evacuated, and how many people could be evacuated, which led to an air of frustration.
“On a human level, that’s quite frustrating… it was required because of the circumstances,” said DeHart as he discussed the constantly changing guidance that consular officer would receive. In some cases, the new guidance meant that someone they had just turned away could have been let in.
Taliban obstacles
The efforts to get people into the airport compound faced countless setbacks, many of which were caused by the Taliban, which maintained security perimeters throughout the city and violently stopped people from reaching the airport.
“The situation was evolving constantly,” Howell said.
“It was the Taliban. It was what will the Taliban allow? What will they let people move through and how will they do it?” she said.
Howell noted that “it was very rare that all the gates (into the airport) were open” because there was so much chaos and violence as people desperately tried to get into the airport. The military would close them when they were deemed unsafe to operate at, Howell explained.
Howell described Abbey Gate, the site of the deadly ISIS-K bombing on August 26 that killed 13 American servicemembers, as “always the one with the most violence, the most issues with the Taliban, the most issues with crowd control.”
Because of the danger and chaos around the big gates into the airport, US officials tried to find other ways to get Americans and vulnerable Afghans in. Those efforts also were met with challenges from the Taliban.
Howell spoke of one incident where she had been briefed that the Taliban agreed to “admit Americans in a controlled fashion” into a passenger terminal, only for them to do nothing “they had agreed to do, and tens of thousands of people overran the passenger terminal.”
Howell said that after having worked on Afghanistan for 19 years it was “a little bit wild to tell people that you can trust the Taliban,” but explained that it was a necessity given the circumstances.
State Department criticism from Pentagon
On the whole, accusations about who was responsible for the chaotic final weeks have fallen largely along party lines, with Republicans pointing fingers at the Biden administration and Democrats casting blame on the Trump administration for the deal that set the US withdrawal into motion.
And when focusing on the withdrawal itself, the handling of the evacuation operation has been one of the areas where the administration, and specifically the State Department, has received the most criticism, as some Americans and thousands of Afghans who had served alongside US forces were left behind.
Milley and retired Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, who were in charge of the US military during the withdrawal, blamed the State Department for not ordering a NEO sooner.
McKenzie, the former commander of US Central Command, said that “the events of mid- and late August 2021 were the direct result of delaying the initiation of the NEO (evacuation) for several months, in fact, until we were in extremis, and the Taliban had overrun the country.”
State Department deputy spokesperson Vedant Patel said in response to the testimony that “the embassy maintained an active emergency action committee planning process that convened repeatedly in 2021 to assess the situation on the ground.”
“It’s also well documented that the US did not want to publicly announce planning for or the start of a NEO so as to not weaken the position of the then-Afghan government, potentially signaling a potential lack of faith,” he said at a press briefing last month.
The State Department officials did not weigh in on whether calling a NEO sooner would have had a substantial impact, as this would have preceded their arrival in Afghanistan. They told congressional investigators they were unsure if additional planning would have mitigated the dynamic challenges they faced.
Although the State Department has faced sharp criticism from the Defense Department – most recently in a congressional hearing with retired Gens. Mark Milley and Kenneth McKenzie – the transcripts suggest there were few of those divisions at play on the ground. Instead, officials spoke to an immense level of coordination within the Kabul airport to try get as many Americans and Afghan allies out of the country before time ran out.
Coordination with the military
And on the ground, as they grappled with the frenzied and fluid situation, State Department officials and service members at Hamid Karzai International Airport were regularly coordinating.
In his January interview, Bass said that “on a daily, sometimes hourly, basis in terms of the operational coordination of aspects of the NEO, I was engaging the senior military commanders regularly.”
DeHart said that he “didn’t find the chain of command to be unclear at any time.” Instead, he found that the emergency environment stripped away the typical bureaucratic constraints and allowed personnel on the ground to respond quickly to the constantly evolving challenges.
Howell described her experience coordinating with the military as “absolute lockstep,” noting that such levels of coordination were “unprecedented in (her) career.”

The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024
Senate primaries are only just beginning, but the matchups in key races that will determine the balance of power in the chamber look relatively settled seven months before the November election.
At the dawn of the second fundraising quarter, the general election is effectively here, and that’s bringing several changes to our list of the top 10 Senate seats most likely to flip. Rankings are based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising figures and historical data about how states and candidates have performed.
Of these 10 seats, only Ohio and Texas have held primaries so far. Nominating contests between April and August will cement what the other races look like.
The top three races on the list – West Virginia, Montana and Ohio – aren’t going anywhere. They’re still the most likely to flip because they’re Democratic-held seats in states that twice backed Donald Trump. In fact, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin’s decision not to run for reelection has essentially handed the seat to Republicans, who need just one or two seats to flip the Senate, depending on who wins the White House this fall.
The presidential race has also settled into a general election tempo. While we’re not done with this year’s presidential nominating contests, both Trump and President Joe Biden have already secured enough delegates to become their respective parties’ presumptive nominees.
The changes in the latest Senate rankings come in the next tier of races, which are presidential battleground states that Biden narrowly won over Trump four years ago and that are likely to see a close race again this year. Wall Street Journal polling released Wednesday, for example, showed no clear leader in Nevada, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, while Trump held a slight lead in Arizona. Republicans have a decent shot at flipping these Senate seats, but it’s nowhere near as strong as their chances of winning the first three states on the list.
Pennsylvania – which had long been at No. 4 because it was the rare GOP-targeted seat that didn’t have a competitive Republican primary – drops down to No. 6. Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick are unopposed in their primaries, but given how settled the other races have also become, they’re no longer the only candidates waging a general election fight this early. Moreover, there’s not enough data at this point that shows Casey in graver danger than other swing-state Democrats, although that could change.
With Pennsylvania’s move, Nevada jumps up two spots. Further down the list, Michigan moves above Wisconsin despite Biden having carried Michigan by a healthier margin in 2020. The president’s campaign received warnings in the form of protest votes from Democratic primary participants in both states this spring over his handling of Israel’s war against Hamas. It’s too early to say whether those voters will come out for Biden this fall, but it ups the imperative for Democratic Senate candidates to drive enthusiasm for their campaigns. Recent Republican primaries have also offered warning signs for Trump about his ability to consolidate party support.
While the Senate map favors the GOP, Democrats contend that their candidates – many of whom are battle-tested incumbents – are well positioned to overperform Biden, especially now that general election contrasts are emerging. Republicans have worked to recruit candidates who can at least partially fund their own races, but their business backgrounds and some out-of-state connections have given Democrats plenty of early ammunition.
Republicans get a win this month, however, with the biggest shake-up to the list. Maryland makes an appearance for the first time, sliding in just above Texas. That means nine of the top 10 seats likely to flip are currently held by Democrats (or, in the case of Arizona, an independent who caucuses with Democrats).
No one expected Maryland to be in play three months ago, but former Gov. Larry Hogan’s February entrance gave the race a jolt. It would take a lot for such a blue state to elect a Republican senator – something Maryland hasn’t done since 1980. And former governors don’t have the best track record at winning federal races in home states that trend in the opposite partisan direction. So it’s very possible the race won’t stay on the rankings for long. But since this list is a snapshot in time, capturing what is likely to happen were the election held today, Maryland’s appearance reflects Hogan’s unique ability to make the race competitive.
With the addition of Maryland, Florida falls off the rankings. That may come as a surprise given this week’s state Supreme Court rulings that cleared the way for a six-week abortion ban to take effect next month and for an abortion rights amendment to appear on the ballot this fall. Democratic former Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell’s campaign called the twin rulings a “game changer” in her challenge to GOP Sen. Rick Scott, while Biden’s campaign argued that Florida – which Trump won by 1 point in 2016 and then 3 points in 2020 – is in play.
There’s little doubt that an abortion-related ballot measure will energize Democratic voters in ways that we’ve seen across the country since the toppling of Roe v. Wade some two years ago. But there’s no concrete evidence yet of that translating into victory for Mucarsel-Powell. Although Scott – a former two-term governor who’s never won election by more than about a point – has plenty of vulnerabilities, he still has the advantage of being a wealthy incumbent in a red-trending state.
But again, this is reflective of the dynamics of the moment – Florida may well return to the list soon. We’ll check back in on the race the next time the rankings are updated.
1. West Virginia
There’s very little that could knock West Virginia off the top of this list before November. Even if Sen. Joe Manchin made a late entry into the race as an independent, it’d be difficult for him to win a third full term against a Trump-endorsed candidate in a state the former president twice carried by wide margins. CNN’s Manu Raju reported last month that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had a conversation with Manchin about a potential independent run, and while the West Virginia Democrat wouldn’t completely rule it out, he called it a “a long, long, long-shot scenario.”
The big name now running on the Democratic side is former energy executive Don Blankenship, who was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety standards after the 2010 explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine that killed 29 workers. Blankenship sought the seat in 2018, finishing third in the GOP primary, and then ran for president in 2020 under the Constitution Party banner. Manchin suggested he’d be looking to see whether Blankenship receives the Democratic nod before reconsidering.
On the Republican side, Gov. Jim Justice, a former Democrat, is the front-runner for the nomination, given his support from Trump and his statewide profile. He faces US Rep. Alex Mooney, a member of the hard-line Freedom Caucus, in the May 14 primary.
2. Montana
As a Democrat in a state Trump twice carried by double digits, Jon Tester is the most vulnerable senator running for reelection. His matchup against Republican Tim Sheehy was all but set earlier this year after Trump endorsed the retired Navy SEAL and US Rep. Matt Rosendale ended his dayslong primary campaign against the national party’s preferred candidate.
Sheehy has been airing ads that show him at the southern border, not uncommon among GOP candidates running in states hundreds of miles from Mexico. In a recent 60-second spot, Sheehy leans into his military service to draw a contrast with “career politicians,” while noting that his successful business career means he doesn’t need money from lobbyists. The ad very prominently shows him driving a white pickup truck with the name of his cattle ranch written on the side.
Democrats are trying to poke holes in that image, highlighting questions about Sheehy’s ranching credentials and his ties to the state – two lines of attack that they successfully used against the Maryland-born Rosendale when he lost to Tester six years ago. Tester, a dirt farmer, is running ads touting his third-generation roots in the state and calling out “wealthy outsiders.”
Painting a strong contrast between Sheehy and Tester is an important part of Democrats’ strategy for holding this seat, which once again largely depends on the senator’s personal brand defying the state’s partisan lean. Republicans are taking the opposite approach as they try to nationalize the race. For example, one National Republican Senatorial Committee ad that hits Tester over the border ends with a clip of him saying, “I’m endorsing Joe Biden for president.”
3. Ohio
With Bernie Moreno winning the GOP nod last month, Democrats got the matchup they were looking for after spending to boost him in the three-way Republican primary. But that doesn’t change this race’s position on the list. Sen. Sherrod Brown remains highly vulnerable as the only other Senate Democrat besides Tester running for reelection in a Trump state.
Like his Montana colleague, the Ohio senator is a three-term incumbent with a well-known state brand – in Brown’s case, as a progressive populist – that has helped him win crossover voters in a Republican-leaning state. Ticket-splitting may be harder this year with Trump also on the ballot. But Democrats see the noncompetitiveness of the presidential contest in Ohio as an advantage that could allow the Senate race to dominate messaging.
Brown’s ads lean into his legislative work, on burn pits, for example. But his spots also promote his past work with Trump – a recent ad features law enforcement officers touting Brown’s sponsorship of legislation targeting illegal drug smuggling that was signed by Trump.
Moreno, a Cleveland businessman who tethered himself during the primary to Trump and his rhetoric about a stolen election, was singing a slightly different tune after becoming the GOP nominee. He refused to say if he believed the 2020 election was stolen when CNN caught up with him in the Capitol late last month. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee quickly went up with a digital ad after Moreno’s primary win that used the words of his Republican rivals to attack him. And Democrats are already hammering him over abortion after he opposed last year’s ballot measure approved by 57% of Ohio voters that enshrined abortion rights in the state constitution. Democrats argue that Moreno’s support for a national ban on most abortions at 15 weeks suggests he wants to overturn the will of Ohio voters.
After an ugly primary, Moreno ended the pre-primary reporting period on February 28 with significantly less cash than Brown – $2.6 million to the senator’s $13.5 million. Brown’s campaign announced raising more than $12 million in the first quarter of 2024. But Moreno, who poured millions of dollars of his own money into his primary campaign, likely has more where that came from.
4. Nevada
Nevada climbs up the rankings, a reflection that despite voting for Biden by a bigger margin than other states on this list, Nevada is not moving in Democrats’ favor demographically. The state’s relatively low percentage of college-educated voters, for example, could make the Senate seat harder to hold than past presidential performance would suggest.
Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen has the advantage of incumbency, but the first-term senator has to differentiate herself from the top of the ticket. “I won’t walk the party line, and I never have,” she says in her first ad, which is running in English and Spanish and touts her work on burn pit legislation and border security. Rosen’s campaign announced a $14 million ad reservation this week, billing it as the largest reservation in state history for a Senate race.
Democrats recognize the challenge – Nevada was one of two states where the Democratic super PAC Senate Majority PAC first laid down ad reservations. Biden carried the state by 2 points in 2020, but the state’s senior senator, Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto, won reelection by less than a point two years later.
Rosen is likely to face Republican Sam Brown, although the Army veteran still faces a crowded June primary. (Jeff Gunter, a former US ambassador to Iceland under Trump, announced that his campaign will be launching a $3.3 million advertising campaign as he bids to stop Brown.) Brown is making his second Senate bid in two years, but unlike Kari Lake in Arizona, he doesn’t have experience running a statewide campaign since his previous Senate attempt ended in the primary. His campaign told Fox News Digital it had raised $2.2 million in the first quarter of the year.
In a state where the issue of abortion rights resonates, Brown has attempted to moderate his message. In an NBC News interview in February, during which he and his wife, Amy, revealed her story of having an abortion when she was 24 and single, Brown said that he’d “close the door” on backing a national ban and that it should be a state issue. He also said he supports the Nevada law that allows abortions up to 24 weeks. But as in other states, Democrats will attempt to nationalize the issue, including pointing to Brown’s own past statements, as they seek to tie him to the GOP’s most restrictive positions.
5. Arizona
Sen. Kyrsten Sinema’s announcement last month that she won’t run for reelection has turned this contest into a two-way race likely between Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake. (Both face minimal opposition in the July primary.)
Sinema’s departure was a relief for Republicans, who feared the independent, who still caucuses with Democrats in the Senate, would split GOP voters. But despite securing the backing of party leaders, Lake hasn’t exactly abandoned her rhetoric about “rigged” elections. After embracing Trump’s 2020 election lies during her gubernatorial run two years ago, she went on to question the integrity of her own result – an issue she hasn’t let go of in the time since. She’s made it an integral part of her public persona, through litigation over the 2022 election and as a surrogate for Trump out of state.
But Lake’s strongest advantage is that she’s well known in this state, which nearly elected her two years ago and still leans red. Trump, for instance, led Biden 47% to 42% among registered Arizona voters in the Wall Street Journal poll.
Republicans argue that Gallego’s background as a progressive congressman puts him to the left of the state, which Biden flipped by less than half a point in 2020. The Marine veteran has an advertising advantage – he’s been on TV introducing himself statewide while Lake has been off the air. His campaign announced this week that it had raised more than $7.5 million in the first quarter of the year – more than double his final quarterly haul of 2023 – and it started April with $9.6 million in the bank. Lake has demonstrated the ability to raise money, but she hasn’t released her first-quarter numbers as yet. She raised $1 million at a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser Wednesday night, a source familiar with the event told CNN’s Kristen Holmes.
6. Pennsylvania
The race in Pennsylvania, where Democratic Sen. Bob Casey is running for a fourth term, is guaranteed to be close, but for now, it slides down the list of seats most likely to flip. Republican Dave McCormick – whose campaign announced raising $6.2 million in the first quarter, including $1 million in self-funding – has effectively been in a general election matchup against Casey since the former hedge fund executive launched his second Senate bid last fall. Casey’s campaign announced raising more than $5.6 million in the first fundraising period.
Casey has had an edge in public polling over the past few months. The presidential race also looks closer here than in other battleground states. The Wall Street Journal poll showed no clear leader as did a CNN survey last month. The CNN poll also found Casey viewed favorably by registered Pennsylvania voters, although 42% had no opinion. McCormick was largely unknown.
Democrats have hammered McCormick as an out-of-touch carpetbagger who lives in a Connecticut mansion. (McCormick flies to Connecticut to see his daughter, who is in school and lives with his ex-wife.) McCormick’s first ad – a coordinated spot launched with the NRSC in late March – plays up his Pennsylvania roots, specifically as a high school, and later West Point, wrestler. “Career politicians don’t do the hard work,” he says. “They’re selfish and soft.” His second ad touts his West Point attendance.
Casey’s first ad, also launched in late March, highlights his work to enact the PACT Act, which expanded health care benefits to millions of veterans who were exposed to toxic burn pits during their military service. Another new ad goes after what the senator dubs “greedflation,” trying to appeal to voters’ concerns about rising prices. With both candidates now on the air, we’ll be watching to see how the poll numbers in this race move over the next few months.
7. Michigan
A CNN poll in Michigan last month spelled out danger for Democrats in this presidential battleground – home to a sizable Arab and Muslim American population – that’s also hosting an open-seat Senate race. Trump led Biden 50% to 42% among registered voters, and Biden was notably trailing among independent and younger voters.
Other surveys have shown a closer race, but the warning signs for the White House are all the more reason for US Rep. Elissa Slotkin, the front-runner for the Democratic nod to succeed retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow, to try to localize the race. Neither she nor Republican Mike Rogers, a former congressman who has the backing of both Trump and the NRSC, was well known to Michigan voters, the CNN poll found. Slotkin’s campaign said it raised $4.4 million in the first quarter of 2024 and is set to report $8.6 million on hand.
Both candidates still face August primaries, although the GOP side offers more excitement with its cast of familiar political characters. Former US Rep. Justin Amash, who left the GOP after saying Trump had committed impeachable offenses following the release of the Mueller report, recently entered the race. Former US Rep. Peter Meijer, who lost his primary after voting to impeach Trump in 2021, got into the race last fall despite discouragement from the national party. Rogers has his own history of criticizing the former president – and even contemplated seeking the White House this cycle – but now that he’s endorsed Trump and has Trump’s endorsement in return, he’s the clear front-runner for the GOP nomination.
8. Wisconsin
Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin finally has a top Republican opponent in Eric Hovde, the CEO of Sunwest Bank, who entered the race in February. Hovde faces only minimal opposition in the August primary and secured Trump’s endorsement at the former president’s Wisconsin rally on Tuesday.
But although he has millions he can throw at a campaign, Hovde hasn’t yet shaken up Wisconsin’s spot on the rankings. He lost a bid for the same seat in 2012, falling in the GOP primary. Since then, he bought a house in Laguna Beach, California – the source of early Democratic attacks trying to tie him to the Golden State. Hovde attempted to prove his Badger State bona fides by sharing video of him shirtless and immersed in a frozen Wisconsin lake in late February. “So the Dems and Sen. Baldwin keep saying I’m not from Wisconsin, which is a complete joke,” Hovde says, before challenging Baldwin to a similar plunge.
Hovde has been running positive spots to introduce himself to voters while trying to put a positive spin on his wealth. In one spot titled “Can’t be Bought,” he promises that if elected, he’ll donate his Senate salary to “Wisconsin charity every year.” Another features his wife touting his “Wisconsin roots.”
Meanwhile, Baldwin, who’s seeking a third term, is trying to play up her bipartisan record. Her first ad features the senator in a hard hat as a worker says, “Tammy Baldwin got President Trump to sign her Made in America bill,” before another adds, “Then, she got President Biden to make it permanent” – a nod to this longtime battleground state, which flipped from Trump to Biden in 2020. A Marquette Law School poll conducted in late January found Baldwin with a 42% favorability rating among registered voters – about the same as Biden’s. (Hovde, who was not yet a candidate, was largely unknown.)
9. Maryland
Maryland makes its debut on the rankings following Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan’s entry into the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin. Biden won this state by more than 30 points in 2020 – which is bigger than Trump’s winning margin in both Montana and Ohio. But just as Tester and Brown have a shot at defying the partisanship of their states, Hogan has a chance in Maryland.
The former two-term governor was in a close race with US Rep. David Trone and with Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks – his two leading Democratic rivals – in a Goucher College/Baltimore Banner poll conducted in March. The survey found him winning about a quarter of Democrats and more than half of independents in those hypothetical matchups. And he held double-digit leads over both of them in a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll that surveyed registered voters earlier in March.
Still, the Post/UMD poll showed that voters overwhelmingly preferred Democratic control of the Senate (55% to 35%). Democrats’ task, therefore, is to make the case to Marylanders over the coming months that their popular former governor would help enable a GOP Senate majority that most of them would oppose. (Hogan has aided in that argument by not committing to vote for legislation that would codify Roe v. Wade at the federal level.) It’s true that governors, former or current, don’t necessarily make good Senate candidates in states that lean the other way – see Democrats Steve Bullock of Montana, Phil Bredesen of Tennessee and Ted Strickland of Ohio or Republican Linda Lingle of Hawaii. But Hogan won reelection by 12 points in 2018 – a strong Democratic year – suggesting he can at least keep this race competitive.
The May 14 primary will decide whether he faces Trone, whom he led 49% to 37% in the Post/UMD poll, or Alsobrooks, whom he led 50% to 36%. Both Democrats bring advantages to the race. Alsobrooks is a Black woman running in a state where Black turnout is key for Democrats. Trone, the owner and co-founder of Total Wine & More, has massive self-funding capacity – he loaned his 2022 House campaign $12.5 million, more than any other House candidate in the country. Trone led Alsobrooks in both the Goucher and Post polls, but a significant percentage remained undecided ahead of the primary.
10. Texas
This is the only Republican-held seat on the list. GOP Sen. Ted Cruz has a formidable challenger in Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, who handily won his primary last month, avoiding a runoff. Democrats are confident that the former NFL player, who flipped a Dallas-area House seat in 2018, is better positioned to unseat Cruz than Beto O’Rourke, who came within 3 points of knocking off the senator six years ago.
So far, Allred has proved to be a strong fundraiser who’s adopted the kind of “rights and freedom” messaging that has helped Democrats parlay the abortion issue into success at the ballot box since the fall of Roe v. Wade. “In Texas, we believe in freedom. Keeping government out of our personal lives,” he says in a recent ad criticizing the state’s six-week abortion ban.
Allred’s challenge is that he’s running in what is still a red state, and Republicans are more prepared for the challenge than they were in 2018. (NRSC Chairman Steve Daines has been sending out fundraising emails that claim the race is “statistically tied.”) There’s some indication that Allred is keeping things more competitive than the top of the ticket. He trailed Cruz by 6 points among registered Texas voters in a recent Marist College poll, while Biden trailed Trump by 11 points.

A drink now may impact you more than it would years ago. Here’s why that’s a problem
Retirement may be time for a lot of fun things, but an increase in drinking shouldn’t be one of them, experts say.
A rise in drinking for people 65 and older is a big problem given the greater health impacts that come with alcohol for older adults, said Dr. George F. Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.
The percentage of older adults who drink each month is increasing — particularly for women, Koob said. And older adults who do drink do so more frequently than people younger than 65 years old, he added.
“The Baby Boomer cohort (born from 1946 to 1964) is changing the landscape of alcohol use among older people in the US in two key ways,” Koob said via email. “First, they have always had a tendency to drink more, as well as use other drugs more, than the cohort before them, so the percentage of older people who drink is going up.”

No longer drinking? There are options for you
The second way is from sheer numbers. The baby boomer generation is large, so the number of people who binge drink, develop alcohol use disorder and die from alcohol is on the rise, he said.
“The rapid growth in the number of drinkers over age 65 could place an increasing burden on our healthcare system,” he said.
Conversations around alcohol have been changing as more people have moved toward alcohol alternatives for a healthy lifestyle, but that culture has been led largely by younger people, Koob said.
“Given alcohol’s historical role in the fabric of everyday life … the aged population may be less aware of the harms,” he said.
A lower tolerance as you age
The first thing older adults should know is that a person isn’t going to react to alcohol the same way in their 70s as they did in their 30s, Koob said.
“The body changes as we age, and these changes render us more susceptible to some of the harms that stem from alcohol use,” he said.
As people age, there is a decrease in the enzyme that metabolizes alcohol, said Dr. Stephanie Collier, director of education in the division of geriatric psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. Older people’s response to a drink is going to be much stronger as their metabolism gets slower, she added.
There is also a reduction in a person’s body water as we age that contributes to a higher blood alcohol concentration, so the same dose of alcohol at a younger age has a much greater impact years later, Koob said.
The risks of drinking for older adults
Those changes on how alcohol affects the body have serious consequences for healthy aging, Koob said.
The impacts of alcohol on things such as driving performance, reaction time, memory and balance are bigger in older adults than younger drinkers, he added.
Balance is particularly a problem considering that the leading cause of injuries among adults ages 65 and older — and studies suggest falls while intoxicated tend to be more severe, Koob said.
Combining alcohol and medication is also risky, and almost 90% of older adults are taking at least one medication regularly, Collier said.
“One study found that older adults are more likely to experience depressed breathing than young adults following a combination of alcohol and opioids,” Koob said. “This is concerning given that opioid overdoses lead to death primarily by depressing breathing.”
Alcohol can also weaken the body’s ability to fight infections, which is even more concerning after the Covid-19 pandemic had such a big impact on the older population, Koob added.
Less alcohol is better
Unfortunately, any amount of drinking just isn’t healthy, Collier said. She recommends her patients not drink at all or switch to nonalcoholic beer if it’s part of their routine.
If that sounds like a tall order, she recommends trying to take a one- or two-week pause from drinking and seeing how you feel.

“If you decrease your alcohol intake and feel better, your body is telling you something,” Koob said in an email.
It can be harder to spot alcohol use disorder or problem drinking in older adults who may be retired, living alone or socializing less because the signs are less overt, Koob said.
There are screening tools available to help decipher whether your drinking is a problem, like the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test–Geriatric Version (SMAST-G), he added. But clinicians should also be asking their patients about drinking behavior regularly.
The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend no more than two drinks in a day for men and one for women, Collier said. But less is better, Koob added.
“We believe that people at any age could benefit from stepping back and taking a look at their current relationship with alcohol,” he said. “We also think that cultivating alternatives to alcohol use for relaxation, socializing, and dealing with stress can result in less alcohol use and better health.”

Unfortunately, any amount of drinking just isn’t healthy, Collier said. She recommends her patients not drink at all or switch to nonalcoholic beer if it’s part of their routine.
If that sounds like a tall order, she recommends trying to take a one- or two-week pause from drinking and seeing how you feel.

“If you decrease your alcohol intake and feel better, your body is telling you something,” Koob said in an email.
It can be harder to spot alcohol use disorder or problem drinking in older adults who may be retired, living alone or socializing less because the signs are less overt, Koob said.
There are screening tools available to help decipher whether your drinking is a problem, like the Short Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test–Geriatric Version (SMAST-G), he added. But clinicians should also be asking their patients about drinking behavior regularly.
The current Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend no more than two drinks in a day for men and one for women, Collier said. But less is better, Koob added.
“We believe that people at any age could benefit from stepping back and taking a look at their current relationship with alcohol,” he said. “We also think that cultivating alternatives to alcohol use for relaxation, socializing, and dealing with stress can result in less alcohol use and better health.”

First-degree relatives are 9 times more likely to develop a serious form of depression, study says
Editor’s note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988 to connect with a trained counselor, or visit the 988 Lifeline website.
Close relatives of people with treatment-resistant depression are nine times more likely to develop depression that also does not respond to traditional treatment, a new study found.
For people with treatment-resistant depression, also known as TRD, standard treatments such as psychiatric therapy and antidepressants may not work well, if at all. A person can be diagnosed with TRD after two rounds of different antidepressants fail to ease their symptoms.

The study is the first and largest to use an entire country’s data to confirm genetic transmission of TRD across families and an association with other major psychiatric disorders, said senior author Dr. Cheng-Ta Li, a professor of medicine at the National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University in Taipei, Taiwan.
Family members of people with TRD were also much more likely to develop other types of psychiatric conditions — such as anxiety, bipolar, obsessive-compulsive or major depressive disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder — as well as be more likely to die by suicide, according to the study.
“This is the most convincing evidence so far that treatment resistant depression tends to run in families,” said Dr. Andrew McIntosh, professor of psychiatry at the Centre for Clinical Brain Sciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He was not involved in the study.
While the findings imply a genetic basis, family members might also share life events or socioeconomic disadvantages or other unidentified risk factors, McIntosh said via email.
“This is especially interesting because this subgroup might have different genetic and other causes for their depression that current antidepressants don’t address as well,” he said.
A case for early alternative treatments
The study, which published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, analyzed national health insurance data for the entire population of Taiwan for a 15-year period, including inpatient and outpatient medical records and prescription information.
More than half a million Taiwanese received a diagnosis of major depressive disorder in that time frame. Of those, more than 21,0000 people went on to be diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression, as defined by undergoing at least three separate courses of antidepressants without success within a two-year period — one more than typically needed for the diagnosis.

First-degree relatives of people with TRD, which include parents, siblings and children, were nine times as likely to develop treatment-resistant depression and were at high risk of all-cause death and death by suicide compared with relatives of people without TRD, the study found.
“The results from our study suggest that other treatment options might be considered earlier if the initial antidepressant treatment fails in depressed patients with a TRD family history,” Li said.
Such alternate treatments might include adding lithium and other atypical antipsychotics, low-dose ketamine, also known as esketamine, or the use of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, a form of shock therapy that doesn’t require sedation and is not associated with cognitive adverse effects, Li said.
“We have for far too long been content to focus on studies of people of European ancestries in Europe and North America (and) we often too easily assume that Europeans are representative of the globe,” McIntosh said. “So, this is a very welcome study indeed and goes someway to addressing the massive underrepresentation of Asian people in studies.”

Is decaf coffee safe to drink? Experts weigh in on claims by health advocacy groups
Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.
For people avoiding caffeine, decaf coffee seems like a harmless option. But some health advocacy groups that argue otherwise are petitioning the US Food and Drug Administration to ban a key chemical involved in the decaffeination process due to cancer concerns.
That chemical is methylene chloride, a colorless liquid that’s used in certain industrial processes, “including paint stripping, pharmaceutical manufacturing, paint remover manufacturing, and metal cleaning and degreasing,” according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
Methylene chloride has long been known to be a carcinogen, designated as such by the National Institutes of Health’s National Toxicology Program, the Environmental Protection Agency and the World Health Organization, said Dr. Maria Doa, senior director of chemical policy for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of five groups and individuals behind two food and color additive petitions sent to the FDA in November.

Yogurts can now make limited claim that they lower type 2 diabetes risk, FDA says
The FDA filed the petitions to its docket for consideration on December 21 and accepted public comments on the filing notice through March 11.
“In addition to being carcinogenic, methylene chloride can cause other health harms, such as liver toxicity and at higher exposures neurological effects, and in some cases death,” Doa added via email. These risks are in the context of external acute exposure to high levels of the chemical, or ingestion of the chemical on its own, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The toxicity of the chemical led the EPA to ban its sale as a paint stripper in 2019; in 2023 the agency proposed a ban of its sale for other consumer uses and many industrial and commercial uses, Doa said. But food uses regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act remain. (The state assembly in California — which has one of the largest economies in the world, often influencing the rest of the nation — recently introduced a bill seeking to ban using methylene chloride in the decaffeination process.)
The Environmental Defense Fund and its co-petitioners argue that by allowing methylene chloride in food, the FDA “has been disregarding” a 66-year-old addition to the federal act called the Delaney Clause, which requires the FDA to ban food additives proven to cause or induce cancer when ingested by humans or animals.
“Thus, these chemicals categorically cannot and should not be deemed as safe,” Doa said.
The FDA has said it is currently reviewing the petitions but does not comment on them while they are under review, an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.
Here’s what experts and the FDA say about this clause in the modern context, and what you should know about the safety of decaf coffee.
What we know about methylene chloride
The FDA has one regulation allowing for the use of methylene chloride as a solvent to decaffeinate coffee, stipulating that “the residues of methylene chloride must not exceed 10 parts per million (0.001%) in decaffeinated roasted coffee and in decaffeinated soluble coffee extract (instant coffee).”

“While methylene chloride may be indirectly involved in food processing, such as in the decaffeination of coffee beans, residue limits have been set to limit exposure,” an FDA spokesperson said via email. “Any food product that contains residues of methylene chloride above the established limits are not permitted for sale or consumption.”
National Coffee Association President and CEO William Murray said banning European Method decaf coffee — the type that uses methylene chloride — “would defy science and harm American’s health.”
“There is no evidence that European Method decaf presents any risk,” he added via email. “Indeed, the overwhelming weight of independent scientific evidence shows that drinking European Method decaf, like all coffee, is associated with decreased risk of multiple cancers and with other significant health benefits.”
But the FDA’s last decision on the chemical’s use for coffee “is decades old and clearly outdated,” Doa said.
“There is more information on the toxicity of methylene chloride and the levels at which it causes this toxicity,” she added. “This information as well as more recent information on how much coffee we drink — just consider the different sizes now available at coffee shops — are key to developing a current picture of how much of a risk the residual methylene chloride could present.”
These days, many people consume portions of beverages or food larger than the smaller standard sizes of decades ago, said Monique Richard, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, a private practice in Tennessee. While a standard cup of coffee was 5 or 8 ounces at one point, she noted that the smallest size at your local coffee shop today is likely 12 ounces.
“But there still isn’t a lot of clear or conclusive research that ingesting residual levels in coffee specifically will cause cancer or other problems,” said Richard, who wasn’t involved in the petitions.
However, “we certainly want to be obviously proactive and be aware of some of these things,” Richard added. “We are exposed to so many things now that anything we can control or ask questions about and decrease that exposure that may be harmful is going to be advantageous.”

The research on what the human body can handle in terms of toxic load is evolving. Researchers have been learning more about genetic disposition and gene expression, which can provide information about what cells can tolerate in terms of an assault on the body. “So it may be less about what’s actually in your coffee, but what other factors are affecting your body?” Richard said. “Even a ‘minute’ amount could be significantly destructive on a cellular level, over time,” she added.
Methylene chloride has long been commonly used in the decaf industry, but some companies have added alternative methods to their toolbox or suspended use entirely.
Starbucks, for example, has three ways to remove caffeine: the natural decaffeination process, which uses liquid carbon dioxide forced into stainless steel tanks at high pressure, drawing out and dissolving the caffeine. Then there is the Swiss Water Process, which decaffeinates the beans by soaking them in warm water. That warm water takes on the flavor of the beans, then is run through an activated charcoal filter that grabs the caffeine molecules. Then the beans are soaked in that water to reintroduce flavor.
Starbucks says its direct contact method is the most commonly used process, which involves a solvent that, along with other liquids used, is ultimately evaporated by the beans being steamed, washed and roasted at over 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius).
CNN has reached out to Starbucks to confirm what that solvent is, as well as to Dunkin’ to determine what its decaffeination process involves.
The Clean Label Project, an organization that tests consumer products for hidden industrial and environmental contaminants, has detected methylene chloride in seven of 17 brands of coffee tested, according to the petition.
The levels of methylene chloride found were very low in most of those seven samples, NCA said — while the FDA’s safe limit is 10 parts per million, one brand had 1.4 parts per million, another contained 3.5 parts per million, and another had 8.9 parts per million.
Doa said t petitioners are of the belief that “although the levels of methylene chloride may generally be minimal, it is completely unnecessary because safer processes for decaffeinating coffee are available and being used,” Doa said.

She added that in addition to consumer exposure at low levels, workers exposed to methylene chloride in factories are subject to greater, unnecessary risks.She
What you can do now
Whether or not the FDA eventually bans methylene chloride is a decision that could take years.
But if you want to avoid potential methylene chloride exposure, when you’re buying decaf coffee, look for product packaging with labels such as solvent-free, Swiss Water processed or certified organic, Doa said.
“As a consumer, always do your research,” Richard said. “Look up what you can about the company. Ask those questions if you can get on a customer hotline on their website.”
Also consider how often you’re drinking decaf coffee, how much and why, she added.
“If you’re concerned about that and you just are confused, there’s lots of substitutes that are caffeine-free,” Richard said. These include beverages made from chicory root, figs and barley, dandelion root, mushroom elixirs, cacao, rooibos and yerba maté.

CPAP replacement works well for the overweight, not obese, study finds
Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.
An implant for obstructive sleep apnea — a serious sleep malady in which breathing stops for 10 seconds to two minutes many times an hour each night — works best in people who are overweight but not severely obese, a new study found.
To qualify for the device, called a hypoglossal nerve stimulator, a person over 18 diagnosed with moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea must be unable to adapt or refuse to wear a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine, the gold standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea.

Biden’s sleep apnea: What is it, and how is it treated?
The new study, published Thursday in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology — Head & Neck Surgery, looked at the body mass index of 76 patients who had received the implant, said senior author Dr. Eric Landsness, an assistant professor of neurology and sleep medicine at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.
Currently, the implant surgery, which costs between $50,000 and $100,000, is approved and covered by Medicare and many insurance companies for people with a BMI of up to 40.
However, “we found for people with a BMI of more than 32, the device might be unsuccessful up to 75% of the time,” Landsness said. “It was a linear relationship: For each unit increase in BMI beyond 32, the odds of successful treatment decreased by approximately 17%.”
As currently defined, a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is a healthy weight, between 25 and 29.5 is overweight, between 30 and 34.9 is obese, between 35 and 39.5 is class 2 obesity, and anything over 40 is “severe” or class 3 obesity, which used to be called morbid obesity. People are considered underweight if their BMI is lower than 18.5.
The study also found the implant was less successful for people who slept on their backs, or what is called the supine position.

The study’s results are consistent with earlier research that showed the efficacy of the device; however, “it also raises questions about whether obesity or supine sleeping limit its effectiveness,” said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson, an associate professor of neurology and preventive medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago. She was not involved with the study.
“There’s a huge unmet need of patients that are suffering with obstructive sleep apnea and not able to tolerate CPAP,” Landsness said. “But this is a surgery, which always carries risk, and it’s expensive, so as doctors we need to be sure the stimulator is the right choice for that patient.”
Adjusting to CPAP
To use a CPAP, a sleeper places a mask over the nose and mouth, then seals the mask to the face with straps and turns on a machine connected to the mask by a hose. Based on that person’s unique requirements, the machine provides air at a pressure just high enough to prevent the collapse of the airway during sleep.
Many people, however, find the mask claustrophobic and ill-fitting, the tubing constrictive and cumbersome and the air pressure either inadequate or too forceful. Many people wake up frequently during the adjustment period, leading some to say their sleep is worse than before starting treatment.
About a third of patients have difficulty using a CPAP and may ultimately abandon the device, Landsness said. If enlarged tonsils, a deviated septum or excessive soft tissue in the throat cause the apnea, a person may require surgery to treat those problems, he added.
Besides CPAP and surgery, treatments for obstructive sleep apnea are minimal, such as dental appliances that try to move the tongue forward, or behavioral changes such as losing weight and asking people to sleep on their sides instead of their backs.
“Rather than not treating the condition, and facing the potential health consequences, the hypoglossal nerve stimulator treatment offers an opportunity that did not previously exist,” said Dr. Brandon Peters-Mathews, who is board-certified in both neurology and sleep medicine and practices at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle. He was not involved in the study.
“Most people recover fairly quickly after surgery, with pain eased in the first days,” Peters-Mathews said in an email. “The device is activated 1 month into use and there can be some discomfort as the intensity of the stimulation is increased. Side effects rarely undermine the therapy.”
What is a hypoglossal nerve stimulator?
The US Food and Drug Administration first approved the hypoglossal nerve stimulator in 2014, and to date the device has been implanted in 60,000 people worldwide, according to the manufacturer. A surgeon places a small instrument, much like a pacemaker, under the skin near the collarbone. Another impact is placed under the jaw, then attached to a nerve that controls the tongue. Both devices are connected with a wire implanted along the neck.
Activated at night via remote control, the apparatus detects each breath and electrically activates the tongue to keep it from obstructing the airway.
“It’s opening your airway by stimulating your tongue to basically move forward,” Landsness said. “The biggest complaint we hear from people is that sometimes their tongue feels tired because that muscle is stimulated over and over again.”

However, it can take up to a year from the first doctor’s visit to full adaptation to the device, with a number of important steps needed along the way, said Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a pulmonary and sleep medicine specialist at Huntington Health in Pasadena, California.
“You must visit an otolaryngologist who will do a procedure called DISE — drug-induced sleep endoscopy — and put a scope called an endoscope through the nose to look at the collapse of the upper airway,” said Dasgupta, who was not involved in the study.
“If the collapse is front to back, such as the tongue falling into the back of the throat, they may be a candidate for the procedure,” he said. “Then you have to do a sleep study to see how much stimulation will be needed to find the correct settings, and sometimes patients don’t tolerate it.”
A dangerous, widespread condition
Nearly 1 billion people worldwide have moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea in which breathing stops for seconds to minutes between 30 to 100 times per hour, according to estimates. Another 425 million people are thought to have a mild to moderate version of the dangerous condition — for those people, breathing stops between five and 29 times per hour.
Imagine what happens when the body stops breathing or doesn’t breathe enough: Oxygen levels, for example, can plummet each night to levels that rushed people with Covid-19 respiratory distress into intensive care during the pandemic.
The ongoing oxygen deprivation can lead to a host of serious medical conditions, such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart failure, stroke and arrhythmias, a disruption in heart rhythm that can lead to sudden death, according to the Mayo Clinic.
Obstructive sleep apnea is also connected to type 2 diabetes, asthma, obesity, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, thyroid disease and mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety.
Yet many people with the condition have no idea they are denying their brains and bodies life-sustaining oxygen, often going undiagnosed until a sleep partner complains of excessive snoring or gasping during sleep, two telltale signs.
“People wake up just enough to start breathing when this happens but often not enough to regain consciousness,” Landsness said. “They can go on like that for years without realizing why they have a lack of focus, low energy and excessive sleepiness during the day.”
New solutions to treat obstructive sleep apnea are desperately needed, so the stimulator’s advent was welcome news to doctors desperate to offer their patients a solution, Landsness said.
“As an alternative treatment for sleep apnea, this hypoglossal nerve stimulation surgery could revolutionize some people’s lives,” he said. “I’ve had patients cry with joy after they have recovered because they have tried so hard and failed with CPAP, and we finally found something that works for them.
“However, it seems a person’s weight seems to be an important factor that predicts whether or not they will respond successfully to the treatment,” he said. “As a sleep doctor, I want this treatment to be given to patients, but I want it to be given to the right patients, the ones who will benefit the most.”

Deep-sea expedition captures stunning images of creatures in Pacific mining zone
Ocean life in deep-sea mining zone
Sign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter. Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.
Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.
Ancient glass sponges. A Barbie-pink sea pig sauntering along the seafloor. A transparent unicumber hovering in the depths.
These wonders are just an initial snapshot of fantastic creatures discovered 16,400 feet (5,000 meters) beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean in a pristine area that’s earmarked as a site for deep-sea mining of critical and rare metals. The natural resources are in high demand for use in solar panels, electric car batteries and other green technologies, among other uses.
The 45-day expedition to the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, which wrapped March 20, documented biodiversity in the abyssal plain. Using a remotely operated vehicle, the team on board the UK research ship James Cook photographed the deep-sea life and took samples for future study.
“We can assume that many of these species will be new to science. Sometimes they have been seen/observed/known before, but not collected or formally described,” said Regen Drennan, a postdoctoral marine biologist at London’s Natural History Museum.
“These specimens will be brought to the NHM London to be identified and studied for years to come.”
The voyage was the second conducted by a UK initiative known as the Seabed Mining and Resilience to Experimental Impact, or SMARTEX, project, involving the Natural History Museum, National Oceanography Centre, British Geological Survey and other institutions.
The US Geological Survey estimates that 21.1 billion dry tons of polymetallic nodules exist in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone — containing more reserves of many critical metals than the world’s land-based reserves combined.
If deep-sea mining follows the same trajectory as offshore oil production, more than one-third of these critical metals will come from deep-ocean mines by 2065, the federal agency estimated.
Scientists believe many of the life-forms that call this environment home would be unlikely to recover from the removal of the nodules and are calling for protections, according to the Natural History Museum.
Weighing biodiversity and industry
In international waters, the Clarion-Clipperton Zone is beyond the jurisdiction of any one country. The International Seabed Authority, under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, has issued 17 exploration contracts. However, several countries, including the United Kingdom and France, have expressed caution, supporting a moratorium or ban on deep-sea mining to safeguard marine ecosystems and conserve biodiversity.
Some 6,000 to 8,000 species could be waiting to be discovered in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, according to a June 2023 study published in the journal Current Biology.
The pink amperima sea cucumber, nicknamed the “Barbie pig,” is one of the largest invertebrates living on the deep-sea floor. Along with the transparent unicumber, the creature is a type of sea pig within the scientific family called Elpidiidae. The Barbie pig grazes upon the small amounts of detritus that descend from surface waters to the seabed and are important in terms of cycling organic matter, explained Drennan, who wasn’t directly involved in the expedition.
“Many species in this family have developed long stout legs that allow them to walk across the seafloor, and elongated mouthparts to pick and choose the detritus they feed on,” Drennan said via email.
The expedition also captured images of elegant, cup-shaped glass sponges, which are thought to have the longest life span of any creature on the planet — up to 15,000 years, although the expedition team doesn’t know how old the sponges they photographed are.
Sea anemones, close relatives of jellyfish, “fill the role of large sit-and-wait carnivores on the deep sea floor, catching small swimming animals in their tentacles,” she added.
Many of the life-forms that live in these depths are reliant on the polymetallic nodules, which form ever so gradually through chemical processes that cause metals to precipitate out of water around shell fragments and shark teeth, according to the Natural History Museum.
Researchers estimate that it takes roughly 1 million years for these nodules to grow just tens of millimeters in size. The largest known nodules reach around 8 inches (20 centimeters) across, which suggests that these environments have remained virtually unchanged at the bottom of the ocean for tens of millions of years.
Critics say that noise could disrupt marine mammals such as whales and dolphins, while plumes of sediment, potentially containing toxic compounds, kicked up by equipment on the seabed may disperse, harming midwater ecosystems, according to recent research.
It’s also possible, these scientists warn, that deep-sea mining could disrupt the way carbon is stored in the ocean, contributing to the climate crisis.
Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the deep-sea mining zone is 16,400 feet beneath the Pacific Ocean’s surface.

Meta’s AI image generator really struggles with the concept of interracial couples
Meta’s AI image generator is coming under fire for its apparent struggles to create images of couples or friends from different racial backgrounds.
When prompted by CNN on Thursday morning to create a picture of an Asian man with a White wife, the tool spit out a slew of images of an East Asian man with an East Asian woman. The same thing happened when prompted by CNN to create an image of an Asian woman with a White husband.
When asked to create an image of a Black woman with a White husband, Meta’s AI feature generated a handful of images featuring Black couples.
The tool also generated images of two Asian women when asked to create an image of an Asian woman and her Caucasian friend. Moreover, a request for an image of a Black woman and her Asian friend resulted in snaps of two Black women.
However, when asked to create an image of a Black Jewish man and his Asian wife, it generated a photo of a Black man wearing a yarmulke and an Asian woman. And after many repeated attempts by CNN to try and get a picture of an interracial couple, the tool did eventually create an image of a White man with a Black woman and of a White man with an Asian woman.
Meta released its AI image generator in December. But tech news outlet The Verge first reported the issue with race on Wednesday, highlighting how the tool “can’t imagine” an Asian man with a White woman.
When asked by CNN to simply generate an image of an interracial couple, meanwhile, the Meta tool responded with: “This image can’t be generated. Please try something else.”
Interracial couples in America, however, are a huge portion of the population. Approximately 19% of married opposite-sex couples were interracial in 2022, according to US Census data, with nearly 29% of opposite-sex unmarried couple households being interracial. And some 31% of married same-sex couples in 2022 were interracial.
Meta referred CNN’s request for comment to a September company blog post on building generative AI features responsibly. “We’re taking steps to reduce bias. Addressing potential bias in generative AI systems is a new area of research,” the blog post states. “As with other AI models, having more people use the features and share feedback can help us refine our approach.”
Meta’s AI image generator also has a disclaimer stating that images generated by AI “may be inaccurate or inappropriate.”

Google halts AI tool’s ability to produce images of people after backlash
Despite the many promises of generative AI’s future potential emanating from the tech industry, the gaffes from Meta’s AI image generator are the latest in a spate of incidents that show how generative AI tools still struggle immensely with the concept of race.
Earlier this year, Google said it was pausing its AI tool Gemini’s ability to generate images of people after it was blasted on social media for producing historically inaccurate images that largely showed people of color in place of White people. OpenAI’s Dall-E image generator, meanwhile, has taken heat for perpetuating harmful racial and ethnic stereotypes.
Generative AI tools like the ones created by Meta, Google and OpenAI are trained on vast troves of online data, and researchers have long warned that they have the potential to replicate the racial biases baked into that information but at a much larger scale.
While seemingly well-intended, some of the recent attempts by tech giants to overcome this issue have embarrassingly backfired, revealing how AI tools might not be ready for prime time.

Generative AI tools like the ones created by Meta, Google and OpenAI are trained on vast troves of online data, and researchers have long warned that they have the potential to replicate the racial biases baked into that information but at a much larger scale.
While seemingly well-intended, some of the recent attempts by tech giants to overcome this issue have embarrassingly backfired, revealing how AI tools might not be ready for prime time.

The Taiwan earthquake is a stark reminder of the risks to the region’s chipmaking industry
The world’s biggest chipmaker is working to resume operations following the massive earthquake that struck Taiwan Wednesday — a welcome sign for makers of products ranging from iPhones and computers to cars and washing machines that rely on advanced semiconductors.
A 7.4 magnitude earthquake struck the island’s east coast Wednesday morning, the strongest in 25 years, killing nine and causing landslides and collapsed structures.
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the leading chipmaker also known as TSMC, operates largely on the opposite side of the island, although the company said its facilities did experience some shaking. TSMC temporarily evacuated some manufacturing plants following the quake but said later Wednesday that staff were safe and had returned to their workplaces.
“A small number of tools were damaged at certain facilities, partially impacting their operations. However, there is no damage to our critical tools,” TSMC said in a statement late Wednesday.

7.4 magnitude quake hits Taiwan, strongest in 25 years
While Wednesday’s earthquake appears unlikely to have any long-term implications for the semiconductor supply chain, it gave a stark reminder of the risks of concentrating crucial microchip manufacturing on an island that is both prone to earthquakes and a hotspot for geopolitical tensions. Chipmakers and governments, including the US government, have in recent years invested billions in efforts to diversify chip production, but many experts worry that process is not happening fast enough.
TSMC produces an estimated 90% of the world’s most advanced semiconductor chips, which power countless devices people rely on daily. Its chips are used by tech giants including Apple, Qualcomm, Nvidia and AMD — and they’re essential for the burgeoning artificial intelligence industry, where chip supply is already constrained.
“I believe it’s an existential threat,” said David Bader, professor and director of the Institute for Data Science at New Jersey Institute of Technology, of the concentration of chipmaking in Taiwan.
“The entire world now works on semiconductor devices powering everything that we do, whether we’re driving in our cars, whether we are talking on our cell phones, even our military defenses or weapons systems, airlines, everything uses chips,” Bader said. “If production were to halt … this would be devastating.”
Recovery efforts underway
TSMC bolstered its earthquake protections in the years following Taiwan’s last major earthquake in 1999.
As of late Wednesday, the company said that more than 70% of the tools in its fabs had been recovered within 10 hours of the earthquake, with recovery levels higher in some newer facilities. TSMC said impacted facilities were expected to resume production throughout Wednesday night.
As of Thursday, TSMC said it expected to have fully recovered operations of all of its facilities by the end of the day. However, it noted that “certain production lines in areas which experienced greater seismic impact are expected to require more time for adjustment and calibration before returning to fully automated production.”
Even an hours-long shutdown of certain chip production could take weeks to recover from.
“Some of the high-end chips need 24/7 seamless operations in vacuum state for a few weeks,” Barclays analysts said in an investor note Wednesday, adding that operation halts could mean “some high-end chips in production may be spoiled.” They noted that TSMC could see a $60 million impact to its second quarter earnings from the disruption.
The potential broader ripple effects for the tech industry will also depend on what kind of chip manufacturing was affected, something that wasn’t immediately clear on Wednesday, according to Gartner analyst Joe Unsworth. Tech companies that rely on GPU chips that help power AI applications, which are already in short supply, will likely be watching closely for potential impacts on that area of production.
Nvidia, the leading designer of GPUs, said in a statement Wednesday that “after consulting with our manufacturing partners, we don’t expect any impact on our supply from the Taiwan earthquake.”
Some other semiconductor and technology manufacturers — including smaller chipmaker United Microelectronics Corporation, memory and storage chipmaker Micron and Apple supplier Foxconn — said Wednesday they were also evaluating the potential impacts of the earthquake on their Taiwan facilities but indicated that they expect little fallout.
The race to diversify chipmaking
Wednesday’s earthquake will likely only add pressure to efforts underway for years to grow chipmaking capacity outside of Taiwan.
Other disasters, including the Covid-19 pandemic and droughts, have previously weighed on semiconductor production in the region and caused chip shortages that raised the prices of consumer goods. Supply chain experts and US officials also worry that US-China trade tensions and military aggression from China against the island could bring consequences for the industry.

“We think the earthquake should serve as a reminder to investors of the risks associated with having so much foundry exposure coming from one region,” CFRA Research analyst Angelo Zino said in an investor note Wednesday.
In 2022, US President Joe Biden signed into law the CHIPS and Science Act, which allocated more than $200 billion in investment over the next five years to help the United States regain a leadership position in semiconductor manufacturing.
And in recent years, TSMC has announced plans for new semiconductor fabs in Japan, Germany and the United States. But plans for its second factory in Arizona — which was announced in 2022 and originally expected to be operational this year — have been repeatedly delayed.
Experts say it’s a sign that the diversification of the chip supply chain is not moving quickly enough to account for the risks of remaining concentrated in Taiwan. Locations for new fabs must have companies or governments willing and able to invest billions to construct the facilities, as well as a large workforce with the skills to do advanced semiconductor manufacturing.
“I think that we are in a critical period for the next several years, until there is a location for a major fab like TSMC that is in a less geopolitical hot zone than Taiwan,” Bader said. “We are really working in a challenging arena for several more years as we wait for that to happen.”

Elon Musk’s X is back to giving out free blue checks. It’s no surprise they were a tough sell
It appears that Elon Musk has finally (mostly) given up on trying to make paid blue checks on X a thing.
This week, X users with large followings were surprised to see that their blue checks — which they had earned under then-Twitter’s previous verification system and lost when Musk purged them for all but paying users — had suddenly reappeared.
The reappearing blue checks came after Musk posted last week that “X accounts with over 2500 verified subscriber followers will get Premium features for free and accounts with over 5000 will get Premium+ for free.”
In other words: prominent users would receive their blue checks back, without having to pay around $11 a month for the platform’s subscription service.
The move is a reversal of one of the biggest changes Musk made when he took over Twitter.
Within weeks of acquiring the platform, the billionaire announced plans to end the existing verification scheme, which was designed to help users trust information being shared by prominent figures but which Musk likened to a “bull***t” system of “lords & peasants.” It was also a business decision. Musk hoped that enough users would buy blue checks for it to become a viable new revenue stream, something that he increasingly needed as he scared off major advertisers.
Now, evidently one of the world’s richest men is back to being okay with a tiered system — he’ll be giving away blue checks to prominent users, but still offering the rest of us plebeians the option to buy one.

Twitter descends into chaos as news outlets and brands lose verification
The return of the free blue check may be a sign that the blue check subscription business hasn’t panned out the way that Musk hoped.
It may not be entirely Musk’s fault — it is historically difficult to get internet users on any platform to pay for a service or feature they previously got for free.
But more than that, trying to get users to shell out for verification was likely a bust because the change itself undermined whatever value the blue check once had that would make people want to pay for it.
“I think it’s an admission that (Musk) still doesn’t really understand what the value of the blue check has always been … the value in it was that when you saw a blue check on a person’s account, you knew that the person was who they were claiming to be,” said Jason Goldman, Twitter’s former head of product, who left the company in 2010. “The value that accrued from that was for Twitter as a whole, not for the person who had a blue check mark.”
X declined to share the current number of X Premium or Premium+ paid subscribers.
Musk’s purge of legacy blue checks was a messy, months-long process. Within hours of the the platform’s first attempt at launching paid verification, accounts for major brands including Nintendo and Eli Lilly were impersonated (Eli Lilly’s share price took a beating that day after the fake account posted, falsely, that the pharmaceutical giant would be lowering insulin prices). The platform then rolled out other forms of verification with checks in other colors for companies and government entities, but Musk continued to insist that individual users should pay for blue checks.
When, months later, the blue checks granted under Twitter’s previous verification scheme finally disappeared, the platform faced frustration and ridicule from some of its most prominent users, including Stephen King and LeBron James.
Since then, the blue check has become little more than a signal that a user is paying a monthly fee to a platform owned by a billionaire. And when anyone could buy a blue check, it was no longer an exclusive symbol that conferred some kind of status.
“When everybody’s a VIP … no one’s a VIP,” said social media consultant Matt Navarra. Now, “the only people that have it are hardcore Elon fans or people who paid because they finally wanted to have a blue check, but now they’re looking around thinking, ‘this doesn’t make me feel special at all.’”
And while Musk has a larger following than most who might be willing to pay for a status symbol that would identify them as part of his in-group, “it will not be the global business that these platforms need to sustain their operational costs,” Goldman said.
Subscribing to X Premium does come with more than a blue check; the company has also touted benefits including the ability for subscribers to have their posts elevated in the X feed, the option to post longer videos and the ability to test the Grok chatbot from Musk’s new AI startup.
But not all of those features have been popular with users. Some have expressed frustration with scam and troll accounts that buy a blue check, manipulating the system in order to end up at the top of other users’ replies. And the issue has only become more prominent since X began offering subscribers a share of ad revenue if their posts rack up enough views.
At this point, many users are not only averse to paying for a blue check, they don’t want one even if it’s free. Within hours of the unpaid blue checks reappearing, users were sharing advice about how to ensure they didn’t show up on their profiles.
“Dear Elon, I don’t want your blue check and don’t know why you gave it to me,” one user posted on the platform Thursday.

China’s internet giants snap up their own shares to boost flagging stock market value
Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.
Chinese internet giants are buying back their shares at a record pace, as they try to boost their market value in the midst of a historic stock rout in the world’s second largest economy.
Alibaba Group (BABA) announced Tuesday that it had bought back $12.5 billion of shares from the US and Hong Kong markets, representing 5.1% of its outstanding shares, in the fiscal year ended March 31.
That would mark the biggest share repurchase by a Chinese tech company in the past year.
In the first quarter alone, Alibaba spent $4.8 billion in buybacks, its second biggest quarterly repurchase in history.
A share buyback usually triggers an increase in price because there will be fewer shares available on the market.
Alibaba’s stock has lost more than a quarter of its value in the past year.
The tech giant’s move comes at a time when Chinese regulators have been asking listed companies to repurchase shares to stabilize market confidence.
China’s stock markets have suffered a protracted slump since their peaks in 2021, with more than $4.5 trillion in market value having been wiped out from the Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hong Kong bourses.
“Alibaba’s decision signals confidence in the company’s future prospects and demonstrate management’s belief in the underlying value of Alibaba’s shares,” said Stephen Innes, managing partner of SPI Asset Management.
But whether the move will give a long-term boost to the share price depends on various factors, including broader market conditions, investor sentiment towards Chinese stocks and Alibaba’s ability to execute its growth strategies effectively, he added.

The Hangzhou-based company has signalled it would buy more. In February, it raised its share buyback plan by another $25 billion through March 2027.
Alibaba has joined a series of Chinese tech companies that have ramped up share buybacks in the past year.
Tencent spent a record 49 billion Hong Kong dollars ($6.3 billion) repurchasing shares in 2023, more than it had spent in total over the past decade, according to the company’s public records.
Last month, the gaming and social media giant pledged to “at least double” the size of its share repurchase to over 100 billion Hong Kong dollars ($12.8 billion) in 2024.
Tencent’s share price has slumped 20% in the past twelve months.
CNN has reached out to Alibaba and Tencent for comment on their repurchase plans.
Major campaign
Other Chinese companies — including Meituan, Kuaishou and Xiaomi — have also ramped up share buybacks in the past year.
Overall, companies listed in Hong Kong spent 126 billion Hong Kong dollars ($16.1 billion) buying back shares in 2023, the highest on record, according to Chinese financial data provider Choice. Tencent alone accounted for about 40% of total share buybacks in the Hong Kong market.
Firms listed in mainland China repurchased 120 billion yuan ($16.6 billion) worth of stocks, more than doubling the amount spent in 2022, according to government statistics.
These efforts are part of a wider campaign by Beijing to draw a line under the stock rout.
In February, the government pumped money into stocks via the country’s sovereign wealth fund and replaced the head of its securities regulator in an apparent attempt to appease public anger.
The efforts appear to have bought Beijing some relief, as the Shanghai and Hong Kong markets have rebounded more than 10% from their recent lows in early February. But they don’t address the underlying challenges the economy faces.
“Investors are worried about China’s economic slowdown, particularly amid challenges such as debt levels, property market risks, and demographic shifts,” Innes said.
Additionally, the global selling of Chinese assets, driven by geopolitical tensions or concerns about regulatory uncertainties, has further pressured Chinese share prices.
While share buybacks can potentially boost investor confidence by signaling management’s belief in the company’s future prospects and its commitment, their impact on reviving global investor confidence in Chinese stocks may be “limited in isolation,” he said.

US government review faults Microsoft for ‘cascade’ of errors that allowed Chinese hackers to breach senior US officials’ emails
Microsoft committed a “cascade” of “avoidable errors” that allowed Chinese hackers to breach the tech giant’s network and later the email accounts of senior US officials last year, including the secretary of commerce, a scathing US government-backed review of the incident has found.
The hack “was preventable and should never have occurred,” says a report released Tuesday by the US Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a group of government and private cybersecurity experts led by the Department of Homeland Security. It was set up by President Joe Biden in 2021 to study the root causes of major hacking incidents.
In particular, the review board faulted Microsoft (MSFT) for not adequately protecting a sensitive cryptographic key that allowed the hackers to remotely sign into their targets’ Outlook accounts by forging credentials.
“Microsoft’s security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul” in light of the company’s “centrality in the technology ecosystem,” the report concludes.
The hack roiled Washington and gave Chinese operatives access to the unclassified email accounts of senior US diplomats, including US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns, on the eve of a high-profile visit by Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China last June, CNN has reported.
The hackers downloaded about 60,000 emails from the State Department alone, department spokesman Matthew Miller has said.
The hackers also breached the email account of Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo ahead of her trip to China last August, Raimondo has confirmed.
China has denied the hacking allegations.
Microsoft said in November it would bolster its security practices for developing software and protecting its users, following the alleged Chinese hacking incident and scrutiny of its security practices from US lawmakers.
“We appreciate the work of the [Cyber Safety Review Board] to investigate the impact of well-resourced nation state threat actors who operate continuously and without meaningful deterrence,” a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement to CNN on Tuesday.
Microsoft has “mobilized our engineering teams to identify and mitigate legacy infrastructure, improve processes, and enforce security benchmarks,” the statement continued. “Our security engineers continue to harden all our systems against attack and implement even more robust sensors and logs to help us detect and repel the cyber-armies of our adversaries.”
Microsoft will review the board’s recommendations, the spokesperson said.
The alleged hack last summer was one of a series of cyber-espionage campaigns tied to China and Russia that have exploited widely use software made by companies like Microsoft to target US national security interests. Russian hackers allegedly infiltrated software made by US firm SolarWinds to steal emails from US government agencies in 2020.
“The US government has reached a decision point with its IT service providers: more of the same or better cybersecurity,” said Cory Simpson, CEO of the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, a think tank.
“I hope this CSRB report is used as a call to action by the US government for meaningful change in its longstanding relationship with Microsoft,” Simpson told CNN.

Elon Musk’s X names new head of safety, nine months after former safety leader’s exit
Elon Musk’s social media platform X on Tuesday announced it’s hiring a new head of safety as it faces ongoing scrutiny over the spread of hateful speech, conspiracy theories and other controversial content on the platform.
Kylie McRoberts — a nearly four-year veteran of the company formerly known as Twitter — will oversee the company’s global safety team and work to build out a new safety hub in Austin, Texas, that CEO Linda Yaccarino announced in January.
McRoberts’ elevation to the role comes nine months after the company’s previous safety leader, Ella Irwin, who oversaw what was then called the Trust and Safety team, resigned after just seven months in the role. Irwin had taken over the job from Yoel Roth, who resigned in the weeks after Musk’s takeover.
Since Musk’s takeover, X has walked back safety measures, restored the accounts of White supremacists and other rule violators and declined to remove pro-Nazi content.
X also announced on Tuesday that it hired Yale Cohen, a former executive at marketing firm Publicis Media, as its head of brand safety and advertising solutions. Cohen’s hire comes amid ongoing efforts at X to encourage advertisers to return to the platform.

Radicalized by the right: Elon Musk puts his conspiratorial thinking on display for the world to see
But both new leaders could face the same challenge Yaccarino has encountered in trying to revive the X brand: Musk himself. Musk has drawn ire for increasingly using his X presence to elevate radical, far-right conspiracy theories, including “Pizzagate” and the racist Great Replacement theory.
In its announcement, X said McRoberts has previously worked on other X safety features including labels that inform a user if their content is being restricted. Going forward, her team will be responsible for “developing new products, tools, and features to protect our platform and community, maintaining our Safety policies, and enhancing our enforcement methodology and operations,” X said.
Yaccarino testified about safety on X before a Senate committee in January, alongside other social media CEOs. In a document submitted to the committee following the hearing, Yaccarino said X has around 2,300 people who work on trust and safety and content moderation, although it was unclear if those are all full-time employees.
McRoberts previously worked in privacy and cybersecurity roles at Google, including on safe web browsing efforts. Her background could indicate a changing perspective on “safety” at X, one that is less focused on content moderation, a practice for which Musk has expressed distaste.
In a post last month, Musk said he would change the name of X’s “Trust and Safety” team to simply the “Safety” team.
“Any organization that puts ‘Trust’ in their name cannot trusted, as that is obviously a euphemism for censorship. We are changing the name of our Trust & Safety group, to simply @Safety,” Musk said. “Trust is something that must be earned. The goal of our Safety team is simply to ensure compliance with the laws that already exist to protect the people.”
Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated when X’s most recent trust and safety leader exited the company. Ella Irwin resigned as head of trust and safety in June 2023.

‘I see the world around me in a brand-new way’: Dubai photographer reveals the UAE’s hidden wildlife
Dubai wildlife photographer captures stunning images of local wildlife
Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.
In a country best known for its soaring skyscrapers, modern architecture and sprawling desert, wildlife isn’t always what comes to mind when people think of the United Arab Emirates (UAE). But Dubai-based photographer Anish Karingattil is determined to change that.
Originally from India, Karingattil moved to Dubai 17 years ago and began photographing wildlife shortly after, specializing in macro photography, using extreme close ups. Highlights of his stunning portfolio of images, taken across the seven Emirates, include a scorpion with her babies, an Arabian horned viper hiding in the desert sand, and two black and yellow mud daubers covered in dew drops.
“Photographers get to tell a story through images,” Karingattil says. “Macro photography allows me to see life and the world around me in a brand-new way.”
Despite its hot climate and harsh desert, the UAE is home to over 1,000 plant and animal species. The waters around the country are home to the largest concentration of Indian Ocean humpbacks dolphin in the world, and the second-largest population of dugongs, after Australia.
With the UAE’s president recently extending the country’s “Year of Sustainability” into 2024, Karingattil uses wildlife photography as a method of capturing the country’s biodiversity and sharing it with others.
While interior design is his full-time job, “herping” is his passion. “Herping is the act of observing, studying, and photographing reptiles and amphibians in their natural habitats,” says Karingattil. “It is a popular hobby among nature enthusiasts and wildlife photographers who are fascinated by the diversity and beauty of these creatures.”
But photographing potentially dangerous animals like snakes and spiders takes a lot of preparation. Before attempting to photograph any wildlife, Karingattil says it is important to research its behavior, habitat and potential risks to understand how to approach it safely and minimize the risk of harm to both the photographer and the animal.
For Karingattil, conservation is an important aspect of wildlife photography, which he believes can serve as a powerful tool for advocacy.
“By documenting the beauty and fragility of the natural world, photographers can help policymakers and the general public understand the value of protecting the environment and the need for sustainable practices,” he says. And with over 69,000 followers on Instagram, Karingattil uses social media to educate people about the species he photographs.
Biodiversity in the UAE
The UAE has 49 terrestrial and marine protected areas, including eight in Dubai. Accounting for over 18% of the country’s land territory and 12% of its marine and coastal territory, these protected areas are often natural reserves which include all the major ecosystems found in the region: mountain, desert, coastal and marine.
Andrew Gardner, associate director of Biodiversity Conservation at Emirates Nature-WWF, says wildlife conservation is recognized as an “important responsibility and obligation by the UAE.” For example, the country is a signatory to multiple international conservation conventions, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, and has helped reintroduce animals such as the Arabian oryx to the Arabian Peninsula. According to Gardner, there are now over 1,600 oryx in two of the UAE’s protected areas, and thousands more in zoos across the region.
However, rapid development and population growth across the Emirates mean that “53% of bird species, 46.7% of mammal species, 19% of reptile species, and 8% of plant species” are endangered, according to a government report.
Gardner says the Arabian wolf and striped hyena have both gone extinct from the UAE in recent decades, and a small population of Arabian leopards that lived the Hajar Mountains until the mid-1990s are now also believed to be extinct.
Karingattil points to habitat loss, climate change and overfishing as some of the major threats facing wildlife in the UAE, but one issue he thinks people should take more action against is plastic pollution.
“Whenever I explore the desert or other areas, I make it a point to clean up the surroundings,” he says. “By removing litter and debris, we can reduce the impact of human activities on the natural world.”

While interior design is his full-time job, “herping” is his passion. “Herping is the act of observing, studying, and photographing reptiles and amphibians in their natural habitats,” says Karingattil. “It is a popular hobby among nature enthusiasts and wildlife photographers who are fascinated by the diversity and beauty of these creatures.”
But photographing potentially dangerous animals like snakes and spiders takes a lot of preparation. Before attempting to photograph any wildlife, Karingattil says it is important to research its behavior, habitat and potential risks to understand how to approach it safely and minimize the risk of harm to both the photographer and the animal.
For Karingattil, conservation is an important aspect of wildlife photography, which he believes can serve as a powerful tool for advocacy.
“By documenting the beauty and fragility of the natural world, photographers can help policymakers and the general public understand the value of protecting the environment and the need for sustainable practices,” he says. And with over 69,000 followers on Instagram, Karingattil uses social media to educate people about the species he photographs.
Biodiversity in the UAE
The UAE has 49 terrestrial and marine protected areas, including eight in Dubai. Accounting for over 18% of the country’s land territory and 12% of its marine and coastal territory, these protected areas are often natural reserves which include all the major ecosystems found in the region: mountain, desert, coastal and marine.
Andrew Gardner, associate director of Biodiversity Conservation at Emirates Nature-WWF, says wildlife conservation is recognized as an “important responsibility and obligation by the UAE.” For example, the country is a signatory to multiple international conservation conventions, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, and has helped reintroduce animals such as the Arabian oryx to the Arabian Peninsula. According to Gardner, there are now over 1,600 oryx in two of the UAE’s protected areas, and thousands more in zoos across the region.
However, rapid development and population growth across the Emirates mean that “53% of bird species, 46.7% of mammal species, 19% of reptile species, and 8% of plant species” are endangered, according to a government report.
Gardner says the Arabian wolf and striped hyena have both gone extinct from the UAE in recent decades, and a small population of Arabian leopards that lived the Hajar Mountains until the mid-1990s are now also believed to be extinct.
Karingattil points to habitat loss, climate change and overfishing as some of the major threats facing wildlife in the UAE, but one issue he thinks people should take more action against is plastic pollution.
“Whenever I explore the desert or other areas, I make it a point to clean up the surroundings,” he says. “By removing litter and debris, we can reduce the impact of human activities on the natural world.”

Dubai is building the world’s tallest residential clock tower
Dubai's most sensational record-breaking structures
Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.
Dubai is set to add another towering figure to its skyline.
The Aeternitas Tower, officially unveiled at a launch event last week, will be the world’s tallest residential clock tower at a staggering 450 meters (1,476 feet) tall — more than four times the height of London’s Big Ben, and just 22 meters (72 feet) short of the world’s tallest residential building, the Central Park Tower in New York City.
Set to become the world’s second-tallest clock tower (after the Makkah Clock Royal Tower in Mecca, Saudi Arabia), Aeternitas Tower is the result of a partnership between Dubai-based real estate developer London Gate and Swiss luxury watch manufacturer Franck Muller.
London Gate purchased the plot of land in Dubai Marina, which already had the beginnings of an unfinished 106-story structure — and knew that the tower’s monumental size needed a striking facade, said Tom Hill, media relations coordinator for the developer.
“We believe the clock will be seen from six kilometers away because of the sheer height of the building,” said Hill, adding that the clock face will be an enormous 40 meters (131 feet) tall and 30 meters (98 feet) wide.
“We wanted to do something different that hasn’t been done before in Dubai,” said Hill.
A timeless tower
The residential tower comprises 649 units, with a mix of one- to three-bedroom apartments, in addition to villa and mansion duplexes.
With housekeeping, a concierge service, and a 24-hour valet and porter, residents will have access to hotel-like services and facilities, but with the privacy and comfort of home.
Its shared amenities range from health facilities, including a gym, padel court, spa, yoga studio, and swimming pool, to arts and culture spaces such as a cinema, music room, and library.
Yet-to-be-built Dubai penthouse sells for record $136 million
The project will be handed over to residents in 2027, according to London Gate.
The tower’s name means “eternity” in Latin, and is inspired by the Franck Muller Aeternitas watch collection — one of the brand’s most complex designs which features an “eternal calendar,” said Erol Baliyan, managing director of Franck Muller in the Middle East and Africa.
The Swiss watchmaker sees its step into real estate as a move that will help create a monument that “mirrors the brand’s innovation, craftsmanship, and timeless elegance,” said Baliyan.
Aside from the striking clock face (inspired by Franck Muller’s art deco-style Long Island Collection, which has irregular squashed and stretched numbers in a rectangular case), the watchmaker will infuse its design ethos throughout the residence, said Baliyan.
He highlights luxury materials like brushed and polished metals, that will be contrasted with marble surfaces, textured fabrics and bold colors. Meanwhile, in the lobby and reception, the signature oblong face of the brand’s Curvex watch is represented with curved walls, archways, and oval furnishings.
“Attention to detail is paramount, with meticulously crafted joinery and carefully arranged lighting and furniture, ensuring a refined ambiance,” said Baliyan.
A booming market
The Aeternitas Tower is part of a growing trend in Dubai. Luxury property is booming in the Emirate, and branded residences — collaborations between designer brands and property developers — are surging in popularity.
As of October 2023, there were 51 completed projects in the city, a figure that is expected to double by 2030, according to Savills Research, with brands like fashion house Karl Lagerfeld, car manufacturer Mercedes-Benz, and hoteliers 25Hours all announcing residential projects in the past year.

London Gate began phase one of its sales last week, with one-bedroom apartments starting at AED 1.6 million ($435,600).
“We’ve had an unbelievable level of interest since the launch,” said Hill, adding that in the first two days, London Gate sold around 30% of the initial 30-floor release, including all the available one-bedroom apartments.
Hill believes that one factor driving interest is the tower’s location in Dubai Marina, where there’s a scarcity of sites for development, adding that an “iconic tower” like the Aeternitas is the first project of its kind to break ground in the district past few years.
While this is London Gate’s first branded residence project, it won’t be its last, said Hill, adding that the company will announce its next branded partnership by the end of Q1 this year.
As a rapidly evolving market, property in Dubai is often sold off-plan, with buyers waiting years to see their purchase. This is where branded residences provide an extra layer of security, particularly for overseas buyers, said Hill.
“When you have a brand as world-renowned as Franck Muller, for example […] you have that peace of mind that you’re going to be handed over a world-class product,” he added.

The ‘Lantern House’ is built on some of the most expensive property in Africa. Take a look inside
Living in sustainable luxury in the 'Lantern House' on Banana Island, Lagos
Architect Tosin Oshinowo is no stranger to versatility. She has designed one of the largest malls in Lagos, Nigeria, beach houses on the city’s coast and homes for internally displaced people in the north of the country. She also runs a bespoke furniture design company, and the Nigerian is the first African woman to curate the Sharjah Architecture Triennial, happening in the United Arab Emirates from November 2023 to March 2024.
In late 2022, she and her design practice, cmDesign Atelier (cmDA), also completed their first residential project in the ultra-exclusive Banana Island neighborhood in Lagos: “The Lantern House.”
Oshinowo says the Lantern House project, a five-bedroom, seven-bathroom, three-story sustainable home, powered entirely by solar energy, was both exciting and a “slow labor of love.”
Contacted by her clients in September 2020, she, alongside her team and specialist contractors for various aspects of the home, started construction in January 2021 and ended last October.
Working on Banana Island
The 1.6 million-square meter (17 million-square feet), man-made Banana Island is named for its shape, and is a private, gated community in Nigeria’s commercial capital. (The exclusive area also made news in April, when a seven-story building under construction collapsed – adding to the list of building collapses in the greater Lagos State.)
With private power and water infrastructure systems, property on the island is some of the most expensive on the continent. That exclusivity was one of the main challenges for the Lantern House project, says Oshinowo, with strictly enforced restricted working hours that made looming deadlines difficult to meet.
Despite this, Oshinowo says seeing her vision come to life was fulfilling, adding that she’s proud of the end result. “It’s one thing to produce great conceptual design. It’s another thing to execute it to a seamless finish,” she said. “It’s such an exciting feeling to think that the decisions that you’ve made have worked.”
She says something the Lantern House project emphasized for her is that “being meticulous in the long run always pays off.” cmDA has since started working on another project on Banana Island.
The story behind this surreal portrait of Ethiopian identity
A childhood dream
Oshinowo remembers wanting to be an architect from the age of 12, looking over floor plans and helping her father to design part of their holiday home when she was young. With degrees in architecture and urban design from the UK as well as an MBA in architecture, she worked for architecture firms in the UK and Europe before moving back to Nigeria in 2009.
The award-winning architect says she founded cmDA in 2012 out of a need to create a strong aesthetic language; one that also projected a contemporary and progressive cultural identity of Africa. “(It’s) very important to create architecture that, as much as possible, can be delivered from what is available in country,” Oshinowo added. “And also in doing that, starting to think about issues to do with sustainability and responsibility towards the environment.”
Pritzker Prize 2022: Francis Kéré becomes first African to win ‘Nobel of architecture’
This bent towards sustainability is something the 43-year-old has carried into her curatorial role for this year’s upcoming Sharjah Architecture Triennial. The theme Oshinowo came up with is “The beauty of impermanence and the architecture of adaptability” which, she says, looks at under-celebrated innovations in the global south that deal with conditions of scarcity. She adds that she hopes the triennial will be an engaging space for the international community.
“It’s a validation to know that coming from Nigeria, practicing as a Black female architect in West Africa, that my work is not just relevant to the context of where we find ourselves now,” Oshinowo said, “in terms of importance relating to sustainability (and) adaptability, but also to equity.”

The UAE’s longest suspended infinity pool just opened on the world’s longest cantilever building
The world's longest cantilever building just opened in Dubai
Editor’s Note: This CNN series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.
Dubai is making a splash with its most recent record-setting structure.
The newly opened twin skyscrapers One Za’abeel are home to the world’s longest cantilever building and on it, the United Arab Emirates’ longest suspended infinity pool, which is 120 meters (393 feet) in length.
A cantilever is a structure that is only connected at one end, and projects horizontally unsupported, like a diving board. The one at One Za’abeel is part of a 230-meter-long (755-foot) structure known as “The Link,” with the cantilever projecting 67.5 meters (221 feet) over the city.
The Link connects the luxury development’s two towers, providing a space for shared facilities and lifestyle amenities, says Fadi Jabri, CEO of Nikken Sekkei Dubai, the architecture firm behind the building.
“Levitating in the air,” the giant glass corridor is an engineering marvel — but it’s not just for show, says Jabri.
The site is bisected by a six-lane highway, which meant building facilities at ground level was not possible, and “there was this need to rejoin those sites,” he explains. The property’s developers negotiated the use of the space below and above the road, allowing them to connect the two towers with a shopping mall beneath the road, and the Link above.
Twenty-five meters (82 feet) high and wide, the cantilever contains three stories and is a key destination for the building’s hotel guests and residents, says Badr Benryane, director of food and beverage at the One&Only Za’abeel resort, which occupies the top 30 floors of one of the towers.
“In the absence of a beach and other water-based activities, our guests will have The Link as their playground,” says Benryane.

“It’s been inspired by the bustling streets of big cities around the world: it’s a futuristic boulevard, so as you walk down the middle of The Link, you will have different dining experiences.”
The Link’s eight restaurants include Tapasake, a poolside Nikkei restaurant serving up Japanese-Peruvian dishes. “On one end, there’s the restaurant with a terrace and indoor seating, and on the other is the pool club where we have amazing VIP cabanas, loungers and daybeds,” says Benryane.
Having taken a dip in the pool himself, Benryane says it’s one of the highlights of the space. “You’re basically in that infinity pool with nothing below you,” he says, adding: “You’re swimming amongst the clouds and overlooking the city — it’s beautiful.”
Temperature regulated and featuring underwater speakers, the unique bathing spot is open to hotel guests and One Za’abeel residents, although tourists and Dubai residents can gain access with a pool day pass, starting from 1,000 dirhams ($272) per person, and going up to $10,000 for VIP cabanas that come equipped with their own sound system, air conditioning, showers, dining rooms and private garden.

World’s deepest pool opens in Dubai, part of huge underwater city
Dubai is home to several record-setting pools: in 2021, the Aura Skypool became the world’s highest 360-degree infinity pool, and the world’s tallest infinity pool inside a building is the 293.9-meter-high (964.2 feet) pool on the 77th floor of the Address Beach Resort in Dubai’s Jumeirah Gate.
This rooftop pool is nearly 1,000 feet above the ground
The Link’s 100-meter (328 feet) elevation and floor-to-ceiling windows provide 360-degree views across the city to the desert beyond, from which the building gets its name (“Za’abeel means the white sands of the region,” explains Badr).
The cantilever isn’t just important for the building’s social space, but also its design: the two towers were built leaning slightly out, so the weight of The Link would pull them both in, strengthening the overall structure, says Jabri.
Weighing nearly 10,000 tons, it was constructed in eight parts and lifted into place with cranes over three days, which required the road below to be closed on several occasions. The $1 billion project was originally expected to open in late 2021, but was delayed by Covid.

The story behind Michael Jordan’s ultra-private, ultra-exclusive personal golf course
Grove XXIII: Inside Michael Jordan's ultra-exclusive golf club
There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.
But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.
Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.
The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.
First contact
For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”
And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.
Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.
With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.
A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.
“I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.
“I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”
The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.
Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.
Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.
“I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.
“He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”
“Slaughterhouse 23”
Weed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing.
For nearly 50 years, only Black men caddied The Masters. One day, they all but vanished
Turning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team.
Dirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style.
Jordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule.
The course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it.
“You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying.
Add to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.”
“It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020.
Weed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction.
“I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said.
“It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.”
To meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal.
Two 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s ShotLink data.
The putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons.
“It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed.
Taking a swing
Compared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse.
Specializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto.
The team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas.
“You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said.
The deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing.
Reyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract.
“The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect.
“There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’”
The elephant in the roof
Inside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop. Hospitality was a priority, with a below-ground level meaning all service, as well as golf cart storage, can be managed from underneath.
Like the course, Jordan’s identity was stamped all over. Columns were set further inside below an overhanging roof to mimic the hang-time that inspired the “Air Jordan” tag, while an elephant print used on some of his shoes was incorporated into the fritted-glass roof, casting the print across the floor when the sun shines through.
Customization goes all the way down to Air Jordan logos on the ice cubes, as PGA Tour pro Jimmy Walker shared to Instagram after a round at the course in March 2021.
Like Weed, Reyes believes his job was made easier by an engaged client.
“He was involved with a lot of the decisions … we didn’t change a color without him knowing,” Reyes said.
“We have had work with other celebrity people and they won’t talk to you, it’s ‘I just want this’ and sort of like, ‘get out of the way.’ But he realized there was a lot of creativity going on and he wanted to be a part of it.”
“No other place I’d rather be”
Given Jordan’s regular on-site visits, there was no big reveal for the owner when the Grove XXIII officially opened in the fall of 2019, but there was a revelation when Weed joined him for his very first round.

When play finished, the architect found himself wrapped in a 6-foot, 6-inch bear hug.
“He looked at me and said, ‘I’m fortunate enough I can be anywhere in the world, but there’s no other place I’d rather be than right here,’” Weed recalled.
“That’s like the ultimate compliment … to have his own golf course and to shape and mold that golf course for him and his friends, it’s just where he wants to be. It’s just a great spot and evolved into something fantastic.
“He’s going to enjoy it as long as he’s playing and then it’s going to get passed along to the next generation — it’s just one of the great things about golf and why it has sustained itself over centuries.”

The story behind Michael Jordan’s ultra-private, ultra-exclusive personal golf course
Grove XXIII: Inside Michael Jordan's ultra-exclusive golf club
There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.
But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.
Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.
The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.
First contact
For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”
And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.
Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.
With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.
A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.
“I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.
“I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”
The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.
Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.
Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.
“I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.
“He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”
“Slaughterhouse 23”

Award-winning close-up photos show the hidden wonders of nature
Photography award celebrates the natural world up-close
Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.
Mesmerizing photos of ants firing acid, a shrimp floating over a rainbow-colored mosaic sea star, and a butterfly peering in at a wedding party are among the winning images of the Close-up Photographer of the Year 2023 competition.
The contest, in its fifth year, celebrates micro and macro photography, striving to show the hidden wonders of the natural world, from microscopic fungi to majestic animals. Micro is the term used for taking photos of tiny subjects that require magnification, while macro involves capturing close-up images of larger subjects.
Tracy Calder, co-founder of the competition and jury member, told CNN how the photos reveal unusual interactions between animals and plants, demonstrating how everything in the natural world is interconnected and interdependent. It “celebrates animals and behavior that people have never seen or encountered before,” she said.
Extraordinary photos reveal the secret kingdom of the soil
This year’s grand prize went to Hungarian photographer Csaba Daróczi, for his black and white image of a Eurasian nuthatch soaring through a forest. Taken with a GoPro from inside a hollowed-out tree stump, the striking image offers a new perspective of the bird against the backdrop of outstretched trees.
The title of young close-up photographer of the year went to 17-year-old Spaniard Carlos Pérez Naval for his image of a Moorish gecko on a wall covered with pyrolusite crystals. “These magnesium minerals create stunning formations, which look just like petrified trees, but they are so small that they’re tricky to spot,” he said in a press release.
“I wanted to capture a gecko in the ‘petrified forest’ for a long time, but they only recently appeared in my village – probably carried in fruit baskets from hotter areas. Due to climate change they can now survive here,” he added.
The jury – made up of 23 photographers, scientists and naturalists – chose the winning photos for each category from a total of 12,000 entries from 67 countries. Many were taken in areas local to the photographers, showing the beauty of what can be seen in your own backyard, said Calder.
Close-up images show insects as you’ve never seen them before
She, along with her husband Daniel, founded the competition in 2018. Both are professional photographers. While many other photo awards feature close-up categories, they believed there was a need for an entire competition dedicated to macro and micro photography.
“It’s often easier for people to get behind conservation stories featuring ‘cute’ or more obvious animals and plants: rhinos, pandas, orchids. But the lesser-known insects and plants we often consider weeds have a huge role to play in keeping everything balanced. Close-up photography often showcases these animals and plants,” she said.
“There’s also a joy in showing people things they wouldn’t be able to see without a macro lens or microscope. Many of the creatures and plants we show are all around us but are never noticed. The competition is a way for them to be noticed,” she added.

Water fights, cultural traditions and new beginnings: A guide to Songkran, Thailand’s annual New Year festival
Songkran Explainer
Editor’s Note: This CNN Travel series is, or was, sponsored by the country it highlights. CNN retains full editorial control over subject matter, reporting and frequency of the articles and videos within the sponsorship, in compliance with our policy.
On the surface, Thailand’s annual Songkran festival appears to be just one great big water fight.
Every April, people young and old take to the streets all over the country, armed with plastic guns and water buckets, and engage in hours-long battles from morning till dusk.
And while that’s certainly the most famous aspect of the celebrations, Songkran is filled with unique cultural traditions, making it an excellent time for travelers to visit.
What exactly is Songkran?
Songkran marks the start of the traditional Thai New Year and is usually celebrated from April 13-15, though some cities stretch out the fun a few extra days.
Taking place at the height of the Thai summer, it’s a time to take a break from work and hit the road, with many people journeying hundreds of kilometers to their hometowns to reconnect with family and friends.
The word “Songkran” is said to have derived from ancient Sanskrit, used to describe the monthly movement within the zodiac.
In 2023, UNESCO added Songkran to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list, noting that it refers to the sun’s annual passing into the Aries constellation, the first sign of the Zodiac, which marks the traditional start of the traditional Thai New Year festival.
“Pouring water is a significant act during Songkran, symbolizing cleansing, reverence and good fortune,” says the UNESCO inscription.
“Other activities include bathing important Buddha images, splashing water on family and friends, folk plays, games, music and feasting.”
It’s the splashing that has turned Songkran into a global sensation in recent decades, with massive water fights held on closed city streets everywhere from Khao San Road and Silom Road in Bangkok to Chiang Mai’s historic Old City.
Pipad Krajaejun, a history lecturer at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, says it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when the water fights became such a key part of the festival.
“However, old photos shot by Boonserm Satraphai of Chiangmai in 1964 show that numerous people engaged in water battles in the Ping River,” he tells CNN Travel.
“According to many elderly people, water fights have been taking place in various places in Thailand for 60-70 years.”
In those days, Pipad says, “everyone played with water in the village, everyone knew each other, and there was kinship,” unlike today’s battles, which can involve thousands of revelers and high-powered water guns.
Bangkok event to highlight Songkran’s cultural side
Today, Songkran celebrations take place all over the country in pretty much every city, town and village. (We’ll share more on the water fights below.)
Some events are organized by local government bodies, while many hospitality businesses including theme parks, hotels, restaurants and bars host their own Songkran-themed parties. Some towns limit the water fights to one day, so be sure to check ahead if you’re planning to join the battles.
Thailand’s Tourism Authority has put together a list of celebrations taking place all over the country, but for those who would like to engage in the cultural side, Bangkok is shaping out to be a top destination for Songkran travelers this year.
The inaugural Maha Songkran World Water Festival 2024 will take place from April 11-15 in the city’s historic old center, around Ratchadamnoen Klang Avenue and Sanam Luang, near popular sites such as the Grand Palace and Temple of the Emerald Buddha.
Among the highlights of the festival is the Maha Songkran Parade, which will happen on April 11. Starting from the Phan Fa Lilat Bridge and concluding at Sanam Luang, it will include 20 grand processions and more than 1,000 performers.
At Sanam Luang – a massive open field in front of the Grand Palace – cultural and musical performances will take place throughout the festival, including the famed Khon masked drama, while a dedicated zone will highlight traditions and festivities unique to the northern, northeastern, eastern, central and southern regions of Thailand.
Splashing will happen in a dedicated water zone with a musical dancing fountain, water tunnel, gigantic wading pool and water station.
Tradition with a touch of modernity
Though Songkran traditions vary all over the country, Thammasat University’s Pipad says two main rituals are still widely carried out today.
On the first day of the new year, on April 13, “people, particularly the elderly, visit temples to sprinkle water on Buddha images” – a ritual that’s known as Song Nam Phra.
“However, each region of Thailand has a slightly different practice; for example, in northern Thailand – or Lanna – people utilize a naga waterspout to pour water on a Buddha image rather than directly,” he says.
“The second tradition (called Rot Nam Dam Hua) is to pour water with perfume and flowers on the hands of the family’s older members, then the elderly will bless their lineage.” This traditionally happens on April 14.
Nowadays, visitors will see Buddha statues placed in businesses too, even in places like shopping malls, accompanied by small silver-hued cups floating in pools of scented water.
Pipad says the act of carrying out Song Nam Phra in shopping malls likely took root in the 1970s or 1980s when retail giants like Central Department Store and MBK started to build large retail centers.
“Song Nam Phra could have worked as a leisure activity because the mall was primarily a destination for urban residents and their families,” he says. “In addition, malls provided air conditioning, which could convince people to come inside rather than visiting temples.”
Safely enjoying the water fights
As water fights take place on streets and in outdoor spaces all over the country, visitors won’t have any issues joining in. Water guns are available for sale everywhere during Songkran, with street vendors often setting up near popular water fight areas.
But there are some important things to consider before heading out.
In terms of safety issues, the number of fatal road accidents is notoriously high during the holiday period, with drunk driving a key factor, while complaints of sexual harassment have been reported as well. Thai officials advise visitors in need of emergency assistance to call their tourist hotline at 1155.
Those heading out should put their valuables in a waterproof pouch – even waterproof phones. Getting wet, white powder smeared on your face is often part of the experience and can result in a gooey mess.
To avoid eye irritation – water cleanliness can be questionable – consider wearing goggles or large, transparent glasses.
The usual common sense applies when out in the heat. Stay hydrated, wear a hat and put on sunscreen. It’s summer in Thailand, with temperatures creeping up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees F) and beyond this time of year.
On the flip side, heading into an air-conditioned vehicle or building while dripping wet can be a real shock to the senses. A towel and a change of clothes in a dry bag come in handy when the splashing is over.
Got an old Hawaiian shirt you’ve been looking for an excuse to wear? Now’s your chance. Songkran revelers often dress up in bright, colorful, flower-covered shirts.
Thailand’s seasonal culinary delights
With Songkran such an important family holiday, food is a huge part of the equation.
This is a diverse country filled with many regional cuisines, meaning every province will have its own culinary traditions.
But there are a few dishes that are particularly special in the summer months.
Among these is a delicacy called “khao chae,” which translates to “rice soaked in water.” A refreshing meal served during the summer months, usually from late March to May, it appears on many seasonal menus, with high-end hotels often serving their own rendition of the classic.
For instance, the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok’s classic khao chae set includes jasmine-infused water with ice and an assortment of side dishes, such as kapi balls, deep-fried shallots and fish, stuffed peppers, shredded pork and fresh vegetables.
And of course we can’t forget the ubiquitous mango sticky rice, a tourist favorite found everywhere from the streets to high-end Thai restaurants. In this special dish, eaten as a snack or dessert, sweet sticky rice is drizzled in a coconut cream sauce and served with ripe mango.
Though available all year, it’s particularly popular in the summer months when mangoes are in season. If you don’t mind battling the crowds, K. Panich is a Bangkok institution that has been serving up mango sticky rice for close to 100 years.
CNN Travel’s Karla Cripps has lived in Thailand for more than 20 years. Though she prefers the traditional elements of the Thai New Year, she’s acquired many hours of experience on the watery Songkran battlefields with her two teenagers.

In 2023, UNESCO added Songkran to its Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity list, noting that it refers to the sun’s annual passing into the Aries constellation, the first sign of the Zodiac, which marks the traditional start of the traditional Thai New Year festival.
“Pouring water is a significant act during Songkran, symbolizing cleansing, reverence and good fortune,” says the UNESCO inscription.
“Other activities include bathing important Buddha images, splashing water on family and friends, folk plays, games, music and feasting.”
It’s the splashing that has turned Songkran into a global sensation in recent decades, with massive water fights held on closed city streets everywhere from Khao San Road and Silom Road in Bangkok to Chiang Mai’s historic Old City.
Pipad Krajaejun, a history lecturer at Bangkok’s Thammasat University, says it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly when the water fights became such a key part of the festival.
“However, old photos shot by Boonserm Satraphai of Chiangmai in 1964 show that numerous people engaged in water battles in the Ping River,” he tells CNN Travel.
“According to many elderly people, water fights have been taking place in various places in Thailand for 60-70 years.”
In those days, Pipad says, “everyone played with water in the village, everyone knew each other, and there was kinship,” unlike today’s battles, which can involve thousands of revelers and high-powered water guns.
Bangkok event to highlight Songkran’s cultural side
Today, Songkran celebrations take place all over the country in pretty much every city, town and village. (We’ll share more on the water fights below.)
Some events are organized by local government bodies, while many hospitality businesses including theme parks, hotels, restaurants and bars host their own Songkran-themed parties. Some towns limit the water fights to one day, so be sure to check ahead if you’re planning to join the battles.
Thailand’s Tourism Authority has put together a list of celebrations taking place all over the country, but for those who would like to engage in the cultural side, Bangkok is shaping out to be a top destination for Songkran travelers this year.
The inaugural Maha Songkran World Water Festival 2024 will take place from April 11-15 in the city’s historic old center, around Ratchadamnoen Klang Avenue and Sanam Luang, near popular sites such as the Grand Palace and Temple of the Emerald Buddha.
Among the highlights of the festival is the Maha Songkran Parade, which will happen on April 11. Starting from the Phan Fa Lilat Bridge and concluding at Sanam Luang, it will include 20 grand processions and more than 1,000 performers.
At Sanam Luang – a massive open field in front of the Grand Palace – cultural and musical performances will take place throughout the festival, including the famed Khon masked drama, while a dedicated zone will highlight traditions and festivities unique to the northern, northeastern, eastern, central and southern regions of Thailand.
Splashing will happen in a dedicated water zone with a musical dancing fountain, water tunnel, gigantic wading pool and water station.
Tradition with a touch of modernity
Though Songkran traditions vary all over the country, Thammasat University’s Pipad says two main rituals are still widely carried out today.
On the first day of the new year, on April 13, “people, particularly the elderly, visit temples to sprinkle water on Buddha images” – a ritual that’s known as Song Nam Phra.
“However, each region of Thailand has a slightly different practice; for example, in northern Thailand – or Lanna – people utilize a naga waterspout to pour water on a Buddha image rather than directly,” he says.
“The second tradition (called Rot Nam Dam Hua) is to pour water with perfume and flowers on the hands of the family’s older members, then the elderly will bless their lineage.” This traditionally happens on April 14.
Nowadays, visitors will see Buddha statues placed in businesses too, even in places like shopping malls, accompanied by small silver-hued cups floating in pools of scented water.
Pipad says the act of carrying out Song Nam Phra in shopping malls likely took root in the 1970s or 1980s when retail giants like Central Department Store and MBK started to build large retail centers.
“Song Nam Phra could have worked as a leisure activity because the mall was primarily a destination for urban residents and their families,” he says. “In addition, malls provided air conditioning, which could convince people to come inside rather than visiting temples.”
Safely enjoying the water fights
As water fights take place on streets and in outdoor spaces all over the country, visitors won’t have any issues joining in. Water guns are available for sale everywhere during Songkran, with street vendors often setting up near popular water fight areas.
But there are some important things to consider before heading out.
In terms of safety issues, the number of fatal road accidents is notoriously high during the holiday period, with drunk driving a key factor, while complaints of sexual harassment have been reported as well. Thai officials advise visitors in need of emergency assistance to call their tourist hotline at 1155.
Those heading out should put their valuables in a waterproof pouch – even waterproof phones. Getting wet, white powder smeared on your face is often part of the experience and can result in a gooey mess.
To avoid eye irritation – water cleanliness can be questionable – consider wearing goggles or large, transparent glasses.
The usual common sense applies when out in the heat. Stay hydrated, wear a hat and put on sunscreen. It’s summer in Thailand, with temperatures creeping up to 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees F) and beyond this time of year.
On the flip side, heading into an air-conditioned vehicle or building while dripping wet can be a real shock to the senses. A towel and a change of clothes in a dry bag come in handy when the splashing is over.
Got an old Hawaiian shirt you’ve been looking for an excuse to wear? Now’s your chance. Songkran revelers often dress up in bright, colorful, flower-covered shirts.
Thailand’s seasonal culinary delights
With Songkran such an important family holiday, food is a huge part of the equation.
This is a diverse country filled with many regional cuisines, meaning every province will have its own culinary traditions.
But there are a few dishes that are particularly special in the summer months.
Among these is a delicacy called “khao chae,” which translates to “rice soaked in water.” A refreshing meal served during the summer months, usually from late March to May, it appears on many seasonal menus, with high-end hotels often serving their own rendition of the classic.
For instance, the Mandarin Oriental Bangkok’s classic khao chae set includes jasmine-infused water with ice and an assortment of side dishes, such as kapi balls, deep-fried shallots and fish, stuffed peppers, shredded pork and fresh vegetables.
And of course we can’t forget the ubiquitous mango sticky rice, a tourist favorite found everywhere from the streets to high-end Thai restaurants. In this special dish, eaten as a snack or dessert, sweet sticky rice is drizzled in a coconut cream sauce and served with ripe mango.
Though available all year, it’s particularly popular in the summer months when mangoes are in season. If you don’t mind battling the crowds, K. Panich is a Bangkok institution that has been serving up mango sticky rice for close to 100 years.
CNN Travel’s Karla Cripps has lived in Thailand for more than 20 years. Though she prefers the traditional elements of the Thai New Year, she’s acquired many hours of experience on the watery Songkran battlefields with her two teenagers.

Disillusioned with life in the US, she moved to Mexico seven years ago. Here’s how it completely changed her life
This American woman moved to Mexico and ended up opening a music school
Her love affair with Mexico began at a young age, and Marjorie Skouras’ passion for the country only grew with the passing of time.
The interior designer, originally from California, first traveled over to visit her uncle, who lived in Baja California, when she was a teenager and continued to visit regularly during her 20s.
“That’s kind of how it all started for me,” Skouras, who studied pre-Columbian art at UCLA, tells CNN Travel.
“The wonder of it all was probably never ever to be repeated in my life. It was that fabulous.”
Lifelong dream
As Skouras’ career developed and she started a family, her visits became less frequent, but her affection for the country remained.
While her family had lived in California for generations, Skouras was becoming more and more disillusioned with life there, and began flirting with the idea of relocating to a different country once her daughter had graduated from high school and left for university.
“It was just becoming increasingly complicated, difficult and expensive to live there [in California,]” she says. “And for quality of life, it was diminishing.”
She considered moving to the island of Corfu in Greece, where she had met her husband, Bruno Bardavid, as well as some other destinations in Europe, but ultimately decided against it.

In July 2014, Skouras found herself back in Mexico and paid a visit to the Yucatán city of Merida, a place she’d heard much about, but had never actually visited.
“We started to come down here to see what it looked like, and we knew within 45 minutes that we wanted to live here,” she says. “It was super weird. Never happened to me in my life before.”
Once they returned home, Skouras began searching for a property in Merida online and went on to buy a 19th century ruin for $210,000 four months later.
“Our house was grand by local standards,” she says of the home, which they spent around two years restoring.
“But you could buy less grand houses for so little money that it was astonishing. That’s all completely changed [now].”
Skouras and Bardavid officially moved to Merida in 2017.
“It was like a fantasy,” she says. “You read all those books about people who do it. My daughter and I watched ‘Under the Tuscan Sun,’ ritualistically every year.
“There’s always been that pull, that concept of leaving. And there was a sense of, ‘You did it, how weird. And here you are now.’”
The fact that both Skouras and her husband, who was born in Argentina, spoke Spanish made the transition much easier.
“There are a lot of people who’ve been here for over 10 years who don’t speak any Spanish at all,” she says. “And I find that to be so peculiar.”
Spanish language
Being able to speak the language also meant that the couple were able to connect with locals relatively easily, which has been “a gateway to a more interesting life,” according to Skouras.
“We very much enjoy spending time with the Mexicans as opposed to just being in that expat community who does not speak Spanish,” she adds.
Skouras describes their first few years in Merida as “magical,” explaining that the city attracted creative people from all over the world at the time.
“It was like a tribe of people that were really interesting to hang out with,” she says. “And the parties were really fun. People were doing a lot of cool stuff.
“It was really truly, truly amazing.”
While the transition to life in Mexico was pretty easy for Skouras, she admits that the country’s approach to time is something that she has always struggled with.
“Time does not exist as you or I understand it,” she says. “ You can say [a] time, but it doesn’t really mean anything.
“Living in the United States, it runs more or less like clockwork in terms of that sort of stuff.
“And here, it just doesn’t, and nobody’s bothered by it, or really cares. And they seem very surprised if you’re concerned.”

She says Bardavid found it quite easy to adapt to this approach, but it’s been more difficult for her.
“I still struggle with it,” she admits. “But 99.9% of the time, the thing gets done, and usually it gets done well.
“It’s considered rude to be in a hurry, literally. And I have to remind myself of that.”
As she settled into life in Mexico, Skouras, who had long been a fan of Mexican fashion, began ordering vintage dresses from the 1960s and ’70s to wear out and about, and often received compliments on the clothing.
Feeling inspired, she decided to open up a boutique near her home in order to showcase the collection of dresses, as well as sell some of her own products, in 2019.
“That was really fun and weird,” she says. “And then Covid came and everything kind of shapeshifted again.
“But at the same time, I realized that that wasn’t the end. I hadn’t arrived. And since then we’ve done this totally different thing.”
Musical connection
In 2021, Skouras and her husband bought a 10 acre stretch of land in Dzemul, a city with a population of around 3,000, and went on to sell their home in Merida.
As they set about building a compound in Dzemul, the couple noticed that there were some extremely deprived sections of the area, and wanted to find a way to help the local children in some way.
“We come here thinking that you have to leave to have a better life, and that is not the viewpoint here at all,” she says.
“But there will be an occasional child who wants to go out to see the bigger world, so how could we help to make that a reality?
“Music and sports are the two obvious ones. So music became the concept, as my husband and I are both ardent fans.”
The couple launched the nonprofit Kookix Music School, which offers free music classes for children of all ages, in September 2021, funding the project themselves.
“We spent half the money that we had saved to build a house out here on that,” she says. “Because we just felt like that was the right thing to do.”
While Skouras entered Mexico with a temporary visa, she is now a permanent resident and is currently applying for Mexican citizenship.
“I love the country,” she adds. “I love the people. And I’d be super, super proud if they accept me. We’ll find out soon.”
In 2022, Skouras’ collection of Mexican dresses was exhibited at the Museo del Arte Popular de Yucatán in Merida, something she describes as a “remarkable and magical experience.”
Tropical storms
While “fires, earthquakes and landslides’” were a constant concern while she was in California, living in Mexico hasn’t exactly meant that Skouras has been able to put natural disasters behind her.
“Here, it’s hurricanes,” she says. “But knock on wood, it’s been 20 years since the last direct hit, where we are. We get heavy tropical storms that are spectacular.”
When it comes to the cost of living, Skouras explains that while gas is less expensive in Mexico, groceries prices can vary, with some of the larger supermarkets “more or less on par” with prices in major supermarkets in the US.
Skouras is often contacted by others who’ve been mulling over the prospect of relocating to Mexico for a while, and tends to advise people to just “do it.”
“It changed our lives in so many meaningful ways that we could never have possibly dreamt up or imagined,” she says.
“It’s a place filled with magic and delight. And there are people offering all sorts of services for people who do not speak the language to ease your future entry, and to help you with your life once you are here.

“So it’s not particularly difficult [to adjust], I think. There are people from all over who come and realize that it’s a great place to be.”
Americans can apply for temporary residence visas allowing them to stay in Mexico for up to four years provided they can prove “economic solvency.”
Perhaps unsurprisingly, the question of safety often comes up when Skouras is asked about her new life in Mexico.
The US State Department currently has “do not travel” advisories in place for six of Mexico’s 32 states, with crime and kidnapping listed as the cause for advisories for the majority.
Although Skouras concedes that there are problems in some sections of the country, she stresses that she’s always felt “completely safe” while living there.
“It’s such a ridiculous question on so many levels, when you compare it to what’s going on in the United States,” she says. “For the moment, we’re completely safe. There’s nothing going on here.”
Seven years after packing up her life in California and heading for Mexico, Skouras’ appreciation for the country, and its people, is stronger than ever.
She travels back to the US around twice a year, but has no plans to return, hoping to remain in Mexico for as long as possible.
“As we go through time here, our connections to the Mexican communities have become much deeper and allowed for a completely different experience,” she says.
“To the extent that we both believe that, for the foreseeable future, we will stay here.”

Israel’s military says it made ‘grave’ mistakes in killing seven aid workers in Gaza. Here’s what we know
Israel’s military said its troops made a series of “grave” mistakes and violated protocol in their strikes that killed seven aid workers in Gaza this week.
An Israeli inquiry published Friday found troops mistakenly thought they were attacking Hamas gunmen when drone strikes targeted three vehicles of the World Central Kitchen (WCK) late Monday night.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) fired two of its officers and reprimanded others for their involvement in the strikes, but WCK has said Israel cannot be trusted to investigate its own errors in Gaza, and the incident has sparked fury from many of Israel’s staunchest allies.
Here’s what we know.
What the IDF says happened
The IDF has been trying to track down and kill Hamas militants in Gaza for nearly six months, and has long accused Hamas of embedding itself in civilian areas like hospitals, schools – and with aid groups.
In its report, the IDF said its troops identified a Hamas gunman in an aid truck in the central Gazan city of Deir al-Balah on Monday, and then identified a second gunman.
“After the vehicles left the warehouse where the aid had been unloaded, one of the commanders mistakenly assumed the gunmen were located inside the accompanying vehicles and that these were Hamas terrorists,” the IDF said.
An IDF spokesperson separately told CNN that the unit responsible thought an object slung over one of the passenger’s shoulders was a weapon, but Israeli officials now believe the object was a bag.
In fact, the vehicles were being driven by workers with the WCK – a charity founded by celebrity chef Jose Andres that has been helping to distribute food in Gaza as the enclave has tipped further towards famine.

Israeli military fires two senior officers as report finds strike on aid workers was in ‘serious violation of commands’
But the Israeli drone operators had not been told by their higher-ups about the humanitarian convoy, according to Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari. In a video statement on Friday, Hagari that “critical information regarding the humanitarian operation” did not “go properly down through the chain of command.
The drone operators proceeded to target the three vehicles with a series of strikes, killing seven workers – three Britons, a Palestinian, a US-Canadian dual citizen, an Australian and a Pole.
Because the strikes happened at night, the surveillance drones could not see the WCK logo on the vehicles, the spokesperson said. The IDF is considering distributing thermal stickers for aid vehicles to prevent this happening again in the future, he added.
After the first vehicle was struck, some of the surviving aid workers fled to the other vehicles in the convoy – which were also struck, the spokesperson said.
Who did the IDF dismiss and punish?
The IDF said the strikes were “a grave mistake stemming from a serious failure due to mistaken identification, errors in decision-making, and an attack contrary to the Standard Operating Procedures.”
In response, the Chief of the General Staff dismissed two officers: The brigade fire support commander (an officer with the rank of major), and the brigade chief of staff (an officer with the rank of colonel in reserve).
The IDF also reprimanded others: the brigade commander and 162nd Division commander.
The Chief of Staff also formally reprimanded the commander of the Southern Command for his overall responsibility in the incident.
Israel’s swift public explanation and admission of guilt is rare, as is for such senior officers to be punished.
What the WCK says
The WCK said earlier in the week that all three vehicles were clearly marked and that their movements were “in full compliance with Israeli authorities, who were aware of their itinerary, route and humanitarian mission.”
Andres accused Israel of “systematically” targeting the aid workers. In a Reuters interview, he said this was not a “bad luck situation where, ‘oops,’ we dropped the bomb in the wrong place.”
Responding to the Israeli report Friday, WCK said Israel had taken “important steps forward” in taking disciplinary action against those responsible, but warned that “without systemic change, there will be more military failures, more apologies and more grieving families.”
WCK said the incident would not have occurred if Israel had not allowed Gaza to run short of food, and called for an independent inquiry into the incident.
“We demand the creation of an independent commission to investigate the killings of our WCK colleagues. The IDF cannot credibly investigate its own failure in Gaza.”
At least 196 humanitarian workers have been killed in the West Bank and Gaza since October, according to the United Nations.
What have the consequences been?
The killing of the seven aid workers sparked condemnation from some of Israel’s most prominent supporters and may mark a turning point in how Israel perpetrates its war in Gaza.
In a phone call on Thursday, US President Joe Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the humanitarian situation in Gaza was unacceptable and warned Israel to address the crisis or face consequences.
The 30-minute conversation was the two leaders’ first phone call since the strike on the WCK convoy.

Biden also said Israel needed to “announce and implement a series of specific, concrete, and measurable steps to address civilian harm, humanitarian suffering, and the safety of aid workers.”
The UK has also responded sharply to the strikes, which killed three British nationals. Alicia Kearns, a Conservative Member of Parliament and Chair of the UK’s Foreign Affairs Select Committee, told the BBC on Friday that she believes “we have no choice but to suspend arms sales” to Israel.
Kearns said Biden’s phone call felt like a “tipping point” in the conflict, but said it is “devastating that it’s taken six months for us to get to a point where it appears that the international community is able to influence Israel’s perpetration of this war.”
Amid strong rebukes from its allies, the strikes may also have played a role in Israel’s security cabinet approving the reopening of the Erez crossing into Gaza, which has been closed since the October 7 Hamas attacks.
But distributing that aid may be difficult, after at least three aid providers said they are suspending operations in the Gaza in the wake of the deadly strikes on the WCK.
In a sign of the delicate balance in Netanyahu’s coalition government, Israel’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir criticised the firing of the army officers, calling it an “abandonment of the soldiers in the middle of a war and a grave mistake that conveys weakness. “

Chumbawamba wants politician to stop playing ’90s hit at rallies
When New Zealand’s populist Deputy Prime Minister Winston Peters strode out to address a political convention in the city of Palmerston North in March, the sound of British punk band Chumbawamba’s iconic song “Tubthumping (I Get Knocked Down)” blared over the speakers.
And while this wasn’t the first time Peters had used or referenced the ‘90s hit, his choice of song has now attracted the vocal displeasure of the band itself.
During his State of the Nation speech, Peters, the leader of the nationalist New Zealand First party, criticized the former Labour government’s policy of co-governance (joint decision-making with the Māori people), and pointed to the emergence of an unspecified “race-based theory” that he compared to a philosophy “seen… in Nazi Germany.” Peters then went on to call for educational reforms, including the removal of “gender, sexuality and relationship-based education guidelines” from schools.
The controversial remarks were met with backlash from other members of New Zealand’s coalition government, which largely comprises the mainstream National and ACT parties. But those headlines were soon eclipsed by Chumbawamba publicly condemning Peters’ use of its song.
“Everything that Peters stands for is counter to Chumbawamba’s world view,” the band’s founding member and former vocalist, Dunstan Bruce, told CNN. “And with that song in particular, a song that was written as an anthem for the underdog, the dispossessed, the working class — it felt so wrong that Peters thought it suitable for himself.”
A self-prescribed “anarchist collective,” Chumbawamba found its voice in the era of ‘80s punk music, building a brand of activism through support and funding for progressive causes — especially after enjoying global commercial success with “Tubthumping” in 1997. The band also famously sold its song “Pass It Along” to automaker General Motors for $70,000 only to donate that money to activists who mounted an environmental campaign against the company.
Chumbawamba, which broke up in 2012, has asked its former record company, Sony Music Publishing, to issue a cease-and-desist letter to New Zealand First. The label did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on potential legal action.
Rights management organization APRA AMCOS NZ, which is responsible for licensing public music performances in New Zealand, told CNN that the owners of the convention hall where the song was played had obtained a license to play music at the venue. But there were conditions: For one, the license didn’t cover any use of music that could “reasonably be regarded as suggesting an approval, affiliation, or endorsement by an artist, songwriter, publisher or record label.”

“Anyone that knows this band and its views would quickly realize that such use in such context would never be approved,” added a spokesperson for APRA AMCOS. The convention hall’s owners did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
“This is so difficult to control, and in looking into ways of stopping Peters we realized that these things are legally vague and take time to enforce,” said Bruce. “If people like Peters want to misuse our music… we should be in a position to respond appropriately.”
Legal considerations
If the matter were ever to land in court, Chumbawamba might need to demonstrate how Peters or New Zealand First had benefited — or how the band had suffered damage — from the alleged infringement, according to Peter Dungate Thrush, a partner and intellectual property rights specialist at New Zealand-based legal firm McCabes and Company.
“One of the issues is that it’s very hard to point to a lot of financial harm that’s being done (to Chumbawamba),” said Thrush, predicting that the money recovered from a legal battle would likely be very small. However, he added, the potential gains for the band may not just be financial: “It will … make the point that they take the copyright seriously, and other people shouldn’t use (the song).”
For Bruce, it’s simple: “We don’t want our name to be associated with people like Peters.”
It’s not the first time a political party in New Zealand has made headlines over its music choices. In a 2017 high court decision, US rapper Eminem was awarded 600,000 New Zealand dollars (then around $415,000) for copyright infringements by New Zealand’s National Party, which had used a track titled “Eminem Esque” in a political ad campaign a few years earlier. The court ruled that the song “substantially copied” the rapper’s Academy Award-winning 2002 hit “Lose Yourself.”
More recently, Eminem took aim at former US Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, reportedly issuing him with a cease-and-desist letter to stop him using “Lose Yourself” on the campaign trail last year. Former US president Donald Trump has meanwhile faced a host of complaints from famous musicians accusing him of using their songs without their consent, including The Rolling Stones, Rihanna, Pharrell Williams and Bruce Springsteen.
Chumbawamba is no stranger to politicians co-opting its music. The right-wing UK Independence Party (UKIP) drew the band’s ire in 2011 when then-leader Nigel Farage walked out to “Tubthumping” at a conference.
UKIP appeared to honor the band’s request to stop using the song. Peters, however, has doubled down, taking to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, to say: “There is nothing to cease or desist.”
Peters went on to claim that the song “worked like a charm” at the convention. In response to CNN’s request for comment, New Zealand First Party President Julian Paul said the party had nothing further to add.
Message of resiliance
Whether music can significantly sway our perceptions of political campaigns or speeches is a matter of debate. According to Emmanuel Heisbourg, a former researcher at the University of Montreal who has studied the influence music in political ads has on people’s views of politicians, removing or changing a song may have “a very, very small impact” on how competent or compassionate candidates appeared, for instance. But it remains an under-researched field, Heisbourg told CNN.
As well as an energetic composition that might whip up fervor in a crowd, the lyrics of “tubthumping” (a British slang word for vociferous political protesting) have clearly struck a chord with those promoting messages of resilience. Peters has referenced the song’s iconic refrain — “I get knocked down, but I get back up again. You’re never gonna keep me down” — before.

Last summer, months before his aforementioned State of the Nation speech — in which he paraphrased Chumbawamba’s lyrics to strike a note of optimism over his government’s performance, evoking cheers and applause from a crowd of supporters and MPs — Peters directly namechecked the band. “As we rise, the dirt will start all over again,” he said during a party convention in July, according to a transcript published by New Zealand First. “In fact, as you know it’s already started. That’s a barometer. That’s a real poll, that’s a sign that our opponents are really worried. Expect it and ignore it. Just repeat to yourself the words of Chumbawamba: ‘I get knocked down but I get up again. You’re never gonna keep me down’.”
For Chumbawamba, the mass appeal and rousing message of their hit is “both a blessing and a curse,” according to Bruce.
“We didn’t realize how much that message would resonate around the world and how it would be applicable in pretty much nearly every situation,” he said. “We want the song to always be a force for good. And to reflect what we believe and stand for. Hence those moments when we have to kick up a fuss when things go awry.”

The 52-year, 1,400-mile effort to finally see an eclipse
Like millions of other Americans, I plan to see the total eclipse Monday afternoon.
Unlike most, I’m ready to take somewhat extreme measures to increase my chances of having clear skies under which to do so.
You see, I’ve been hoping to see an eclipse for the past 52 years, starting with an 1,800-mile round trip as an 11-year-old. But that eclipse was clouded out at the last moment.
My most recent eclipse hunt was a trip to the Midwest that included more than 500 miles of driving that ended with me and family members huddled underneath a canopy in the rain. I got to see the land around me turn dark as night both times. But little else.
So this year when I made plans as to where I would see the eclipse, I decided to build my plans around two words – mobility and flexibility. When someone asked recently where I was going to see the eclipse, I responded “Somewhere along a 1,400-mile stretch of the path of totality.”
That range of options stretches from Pocahontas, Arkansas, in the northern part of that state, to Hartland, New Brunswick, in Canada, just over the border from Maine.
But just days away from the big event, I’m still not sure what my plans will entail or if they will be enough.
Past disappointments
The willingness to spend so many hours in the car, binging on podcasts, looking at the skies and crossing my fingers, is probably a result of severe disappointment 52 years ago, and the repeat disappointment seven years ago.
Unlike this “Great American Eclipse,” the July 1972 eclipse was primarily a Canadian event, touching the United States only in northern Alaska.
My efforts to see it came after a 900-mile drive to northern Quebec with the members of the Robert E. Bell Middle School astronomy club. Leading the trip was Mr. Moore, the teacher adviser to the club who I realize now must have been some kind of saint to volunteer to make such a trip with a Volkswagen camper van full of 6th-, 7th- and 8th-grade geeks.
I remember a lot about that trip.
I remember learning to play poker at one of the campgrounds where we stopped.
I remember the McGovern bumper sticker on Mr. Moore’s van.
I remember the beautiful lake we found hiking from a campsite the night before the eclipse, picturesque enough that myself and another member of the club decided to pitch our tent there rather than stay with the larger group.
And I remember the sand flies that got into the tent and nearly ate us alive during the night, leaving my back covered with scores of red welts.
But most of what I remember are the clouds that came between us and the sun just before the eclipse started and stayed in place until it ended. And I remember my tears that followed.
A second failed attempt
The disappointment of 2017 was nothing by comparison. It was actually a fun trip with a dozen family members. The rest of the group didn’t even seem disappointed that they only got to see the landscape around us turn dark rather than seeing the eclipse itself.
But the 11-year old version of me was terribly disappointed once again, and while I avoided tears that time, I didn’t hide my frustration as well as I should have.
So that’s why I’ve been planning a more mobile and extreme effort this time, which was enough to scare my wife, Liz, off the idea of joining me and my 21-year old daughter, a former high school astronomy club co-president herself.
When Liz asked me why I was willing to spend essentially days in a car driving long distances for just the chance to view a few minutes of an eclipse under clear skies, I responded, “Is there anything you’ve been trying to do for more than 50 years that you haven’t been able to do?”
That question seemed to satisfy her. And even if her answer to the question was no, that didn’t change her willingness to join us.
When I explained my plans to my boss, he responded, “You’re committed.” And I replied, “Liz certainly thinks I should be.”
Hitting the road
Our plans only required me to book one plane trip for my daughter and myself, to and from St. Louis, on refundable Delta Air Lines flights on Saturday and Monday.
Being in St. Louis would position us to drive anywhere along a 400-mile stretch of the path of totality on Monday morning, from northern Arkansas to Bloomington, Indiana, and still make it back to the St. Louis airport for our flight home that evening. Getting home quickly is a key so my daughter can be back in her college classes the next day.
Any viewing point north and east of that part of the path we can accomplish by driving from my home in New Jersey. Indianapolis would be a stretch – about an 11-hour drive. But doable. My daughter is game for coming along for the long car ride to most of those locations.
And the drive would get shorter the further east our viewing plans move, until I would be only about a four-and-a-half-hour drive to Oswego, New York, on the shores of Lake Ontario, near Rochester.
And if the viewing point moves east of there, I could still see the eclipse with a slightly longer drive. It’ll be a mere nine-and-a-half-hour drive to the aforementioned Hartland, New Brunswick, home of the world’s longest covered bridge, according to Google.
Troubling forecasts
I was thinking I might have a large number of options to choose from and a near certainty of finding clear skies.
But the early cloud and weather forecasts are not looking promising. Most of my 1,400 mile stretch of the path has a good chance of rain, let alone clouds. And the forecast is even worse in normally sunny locations further south and west in places such as Texas.
Looking ahead to the eclipse forecasts weeks or months ago, the assumption might have been that Texas and further south would have prime viewing weather. But that’s just not the way it worked out, CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward told me Thursday afternoon.
“That’s the difference between climate and weather,” he said. “It might average out that Texas is better but right now it’s not looking that way.”
Meanwhile, locations in northern New England relatively close to my New Jersey home (compared to the rest of the path) might be the best bet, even though much of that area was being hit with an April snow storm Thursday.
“I think northern New England seems the safest of all right now. It’s been a miserable day today, but that will change as we head to the weekend,” Ward told me. He cautioned me things could change between now and Monday, though.
So right now I’m looking primarily at locations in western or upstate New York, northernmost Vermont and New Hampshire or Maine as my best shot at clear skies, even if it’s possible my daughter and I will be standing in the slushy remains of snow.
Still, I’m hopeful. And I’ve needed to make only a couple of hotel reservations – one in St. Louis, one in Portland, Maine. Friends and family stretched from Indianapolis to New Hampshire would be able to accommodate me elsewhere on the path.
But if all the planning and checking forecasts and making plans isn’t enough this time, I’m already looking ahead.
There’s an eclipse in western Alaska and the Bering Strait in 2033. I’m guessing there will be cruises then that negate the need for long car drives. And there’ll be one in Montana on August 23, 2044, my 84th birthday as it so happens, assuming I’m still mobile enough then.
But here’s hoping I can finally achieve my half-century quest to see an eclipse and neither myself nor my daughter have to wait that long.

As the world ages, cancer cases are projected to rise, hitting some countries like ‘a tidal wave’
Around the world each year, tens of millions of people are told they have cancer, and millions die from the disease. Now, a report from the American Cancer Society projects that by 2050, the number of people with cancer could rise 77%.
The report, published Thursday in the journal CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians, found that in 2022 – the most recent year for which data was available – about 20 million cases of cancer were diagnosed alongside 9.7 million deaths from cancer.
Those estimates suggest that about 1 in 5 people who are alive now will develop cancer in their lifetime, and around 1 in 9 men and 1 in 12 women will die from the disease.

Global cancer cases will jump 77% by 2050, WHO report estimates
When it comes to the number of cases around the world, “we think that number will go up to 35 million by 2050, largely due to an increasing population in the aging population,” said Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer for the American Cancer Society.
The new report says population growth and aging are key drivers of the size of the world’s cancer burden, with the global population of about 8 billion people in 2022 projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050.
But if more people also use tobacco and more have obesity, along with other risk factors for cancer, the projected number of cancer cases could get even higher, Dahut warned, especially in low-income countries.
“A lot of the drivers for cancer that we’ve traditionally seen in high-income countries, such as tobacco and obesity, these same cancer drivers are now moving into the low-income countries,” Dahut said, adding that this trend is worrisome.
“These are countries that do not have the tools to find cancer early, treat cancer appropriately and prevent it in ways that are often being done in other countries,” he said. “We’re worried that we’re going to see increased incidence rates, increased mortality rates, particularly in low-income countries, where the cancers are now being driven not only by traditional cancer drivers but also by external things such as tobacco and obesity.”
The most common cancer in the world
The new report includes global data on cancer incidence and death from the Global Cancer Observatory, a World Health Organization database.
The data shows that lung cancer was the most frequently diagnosed form worldwide in 2022, with almost 2.5 million new cases and more than 1.8 million deaths.
Overall, the top 10 cancer types in both men and women accounted for more than 60% of newly diagnosed cancer cases and cancer deaths, according to the report.

The most common cancer types are lung, breast in women, colorectal, prostate, stomach, liver, thyroid, cervical, bladder and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, according to the report. Lung cancer was also the leading cause of cancer deaths, followed by colorectal, liver, breast in women, stomach, pancreatic, esophagus, prostate, cervical and leukemia.
Cervical cancer was the leading cause of cancer death in 37 countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and southeastern Asia, according to the report. The HPV or human papillomavirus vaccine can reduce a person’s risk of cervical cancer, but globally, only about 15% of eligible girls have received the vaccine, according to the American Cancer Society. There are also disparities in screening for cervical cancer.
“With more than half of cancer deaths worldwide being potentially preventable, prevention offers the most cost-effective and sustainable strategy for cancer control,” Dr. Ahmedin Jemal, senior vice president of surveillance & health equity science at the American Cancer Society and senior author of the study, said in a news release. “Elimination of tobacco use alone could prevent 1 in 4 cancer deaths or approximately 2.6 million cancer deaths annually.”
Even though the causes of cancer can be complex, genetic or environmental, “about 50% of cancers are preventable,” Dr. Bilal Siddiqui, an oncologist and assistant professor at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, who was not involved in the new report, said in an email.
“All patients should talk to their doctors to ensure they receive age-appropriate cancer screenings, and it’s important to make the key lifestyle changes that can reduce our risk for cancer, including stopping smoking, reducing alcohol intake, and staying physically active,” he said.
Prostate cancers projected to double
Concern grows also particularly around prostate cancer.
A separate report, published Thursday in the journal The Lancet, projects that the number of new cases of prostate cancer annually will rise from about 1.4 million in 2020 to 2.9 million by 2040.
Prostate cancer is one of the most diagnosed cancers, accounting for about 15% of new cancer cases in the United States. Globally, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men across 112 countries, according to the new report, from The Lancet Commission on prostate cancer.

Cancer rate ticks up among middle aged
“In terms of the overall global health burden of prostate cancer, I think the numbers are somewhat surprising but expected at the same time. Globally, the population is aging, and prostate cancer is primarily a disease of aging,” said Dr. Brandon Mahal, radiation oncologist and translational epidemiologist at Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who was an author of the new report.
“As we continue to increase life expectancy, especially in low- and middle-income countries, you can expect that diseases of aging – specifically, such as a common cancer like prostate cancer – would become a greater burden,” Mahal said.
He added that prostate cancer continues to disproportionately affect the Black community, “although there will be some increase globally in every country.”
The new report makes recommendations for addressing the “four highest-priority areas” that relate to prostate cancer. It recommends modifying ways to detect prostate cancer early while avoiding overdiagnosis and overtreatment of trivial disease; improving methods to empower patients with health information and potentially facilitate the use of artificial intelligence; implementing targeted guidelines for therapies, especially surgery and radiotherapy; and investing in research.
The commission’s report puts in perspective the “critical need for strategies for early diagnosis and effective treatment of this disease,” Siddiqui said in the email.
“The Commission made four recommendations to help improve diagnosis and management and reduce death from prostate cancer,” he said. “These are smart solutions that our governments and health care funding agencies should support and could help reduce lives lost due to prostate cancer.”
‘Cancer is a tidal wave coming’
Tobacco remains “the principal cause of lung cancer,” according to the new American Cancer Society report, which adds that the disease can largely be prevented through effective tobacco control policies and regulations. As for other types of cancer, reducing excess body weight, reducing alcohol consumption, not smoking and increasing physical activity can help lower a person’s risk.

“While we do see lung cancers that are not related to smoking, the number one cause of lung cancer is smoking. And so obviously, there’s still much work to be done in the US and everywhere to continue to address the epidemic of smoking,” said Dr. Harold Burstein, an oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and professor at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the new American Cancer Society report.
“Interestingly, pollution and other airborne environmental exposures probably increase the risk of lung cancer in many parts of the world. And so efforts to improve clean air or to reduce exposure to airborne pollution is another really important thing to think about,” Burstein said.
“Other things that people can do to reduce their cancer mortality include screening for early cancer detection and better outcomes. In the US, we have very vigorous opportunities for screening with mammography, colonoscopy and Pap smears, but these are still often under-utilized by many parts of our society,” he said. “In the more advanced economies, like the US, we have seen remarkable declines in the rates of mortality from breast cancer and colon cancer, probably about half of that due to early detection.”
The new report details how many low-income countries have high cancer death rates despite low cancer incidence, largely due to a lack of access to screening tools to spot the disease early and advanced treatment services.

The report helps highlight not only these global trends in cancer but also how cancer is becoming a “bigger health problem” in lower- and middle-income regions of the world, Burstein said.
“Cancer is a tidal wave coming into their communities,” he said.
“They do not have screening mammograms in most of sub-Saharan Africa. They do not have screening mammograms in China. They do not have routine colonoscopies in many parts of the world,” he said. “The report says that the prevalence of cancer will double in low- and middle-income countries in the next 25 years. And so, dealing with both the surging prevalence, the need for early detection and screening, and then the complex treatment and care of patients with cancer is going to be a huge challenge for health care systems that are already stretched.”

Is decaf coffee safe to drink? Experts weigh in on claims by health advocacy groups
Sign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter. Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.
For people avoiding caffeine, decaf coffee seems like a harmless option. But some health advocacy groups that argue otherwise are petitioning the US Food and Drug Administration to ban a key chemical involved in the decaffeination process due to cancer concerns.
That chemical is methylene chloride, a colorless liquid that’s used in certain industrial processes, “including paint stripping, pharmaceutical manufacturing, paint remover manufacturing, and metal cleaning and degreasing,” according to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
Methylene chloride has long been known to be a carcinogen, designated as such by the National Institutes of Health’s National Toxicology Program, the Environmental Protection Agency and the World Health Organization, said Dr. Maria Doa, senior director of chemical policy for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of five groups and individuals behind two food and color additive petitions sent to the FDA in November.

Yogurts can now make limited claim that they lower type 2 diabetes risk, FDA says
The FDA filed the petitions to its docket for consideration on December 21 and accepted public comments on the filing notice through March 11.
“In addition to being carcinogenic, methylene chloride can cause other health harms, such as liver toxicity and at higher exposures neurological effects, and in some cases death,” Doa added via email. These risks are in the context of external acute exposure to high levels of the chemical, or ingestion of the chemical on its own, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The toxicity of the chemical led the EPA to ban its sale as a paint stripper in 2019; in 2023 the agency proposed a ban of its sale for other consumer uses and many industrial and commercial uses, Doa said. But food uses regulated by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act remain. (The state assembly in California — which has one of the largest economies in the world, often influencing the rest of the nation — recently introduced a bill seeking to ban using methylene chloride in the decaffeination process.)
The Environmental Defense Fund and its co-petitioners argue that by allowing methylene chloride in food, the FDA “has been disregarding” a 66-year-old addition to the federal act called the Delaney Clause, which requires the FDA to ban food additives proven to cause or induce cancer when ingested by humans or animals.
“Thus, these chemicals categorically cannot and should not be deemed as safe,” Doa said.
The FDA has said it is currently reviewing the petitions but does not comment on them while they are under review, an FDA spokesperson said in a statement.
Here’s what experts and the FDA say about this clause in the modern context, and what you should know about the safety of decaf coffee.
What we know about methylene chloride
The FDA has one regulation allowing for the use of methylene chloride as a solvent to decaffeinate coffee, stipulating that “the residues of methylene chloride must not exceed 10 parts per million (0.001%) in decaffeinated roasted coffee and in decaffeinated soluble coffee extract (instant coffee).”

“While methylene chloride may be indirectly involved in food processing, such as in the decaffeination of coffee beans, residue limits have been set to limit exposure,” an FDA spokesperson said via email. “Any food product that contains residues of methylene chloride above the established limits are not permitted for sale or consumption.”
National Coffee Association President and CEO William Murray said banning European Method decaf coffee — the type that uses methylene chloride — “would defy science and harm American’s health.”
“There is no evidence that European Method decaf presents any risk,” he added via email. “Indeed, the overwhelming weight of independent scientific evidence shows that drinking European Method decaf, like all coffee, is associated with decreased risk of multiple cancers and with other significant health benefits.”
But the FDA’s last decision on the chemical’s use for coffee “is decades old and clearly outdated,” Doa said.
“There is more information on the toxicity of methylene chloride and the levels at which it causes this toxicity,” she added. “This information as well as more recent information on how much coffee we drink — just consider the different sizes now available at coffee shops — are key to developing a current picture of how much of a risk the residual methylene chloride could present.”
These days, many people consume portions of beverages or food larger than the smaller standard sizes of decades ago, said Monique Richard, a registered dietitian nutritionist and owner of Nutrition-In-Sight, a private practice in Tennessee. While a standard cup of coffee was 5 or 8 ounces at one point, she noted that the smallest size at your local coffee shop today is likely 12 ounces.
“But there still isn’t a lot of clear or conclusive research that ingesting residual levels in coffee specifically will cause cancer or other problems,” said Richard, who wasn’t involved in the petitions.
However, “we certainly want to be obviously proactive and be aware of some of these things,” Richard added. “We are exposed to so many things now that anything we can control or ask questions about and decrease that exposure that may be harmful is going to be advantageous.”

The research on what the human body can handle in terms of toxic load is evolving. Researchers have been learning more about genetic disposition and gene expression, which can provide information about what cells can tolerate in terms of an assault on the body. “So it may be less about what’s actually in your coffee, but what other factors are affecting your body?” Richard said. “Even a ‘minute’ amount could be significantly destructive on a cellular level, over time,” she added.
Methylene chloride has long been commonly used in the decaf industry, but some companies have added alternative methods to their toolbox or suspended use entirely.
Starbucks, for example, has three ways to remove caffeine: the natural decaffeination process, which uses liquid carbon dioxide forced into stainless steel tanks at high pressure, drawing out and dissolving the caffeine. Then there is the Swiss Water Process, which decaffeinates the beans by soaking them in warm water. That warm water takes on the flavor of the beans, then is run through an activated charcoal filter that grabs the caffeine molecules. Then the beans are soaked in that water to reintroduce flavor.
Starbucks says its direct contact method is the most commonly used process, which involves a solvent that, along with other liquids used, is ultimately evaporated by the beans being steamed, washed and roasted at over 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 degrees Celsius).
CNN has reached out to Starbucks to confirm what that solvent is, as well as to Dunkin’ to determine what its decaffeination process involves.
The Clean Label Project, an organization that tests consumer products for hidden industrial and environmental contaminants, has detected methylene chloride in seven of 17 brands of coffee tested, according to the petition.
The levels of methylene chloride found were very low in most of those seven samples, NCA said — while the FDA’s safe limit is 10 parts per million, one brand had 1.4 parts per million, another contained 3.5 parts per million, and another had 8.9 parts per million.
Doa said t petitioners are of the belief that “although the levels of methylene chloride may generally be minimal, it is completely unnecessary because safer processes for decaffeinating coffee are available and being used,” Doa said.

What you can do now
Whether or not the FDA eventually bans methylene chloride is a decision that could take years.
But if you want to avoid potential methylene chloride exposure, when you’re buying decaf coffee, look for product packaging with labels such as solvent-free, Swiss Water processed or certified organic, Doa said.
“As a consumer, always do your research,” Richard said. “Look up what you can about the company. Ask those questions if you can get on a customer hotline on their website.”
Also consider how often you’re drinking decaf coffee, how much and why, she added.
“If you’re concerned about that and you just are confused, there’s lots of substitutes that are caffeine-free,” Richard said. These include beverages made from chicory root, figs and barley, dandelion root, mushroom elixirs, cacao, rooibos and yerba maté.

There are currently 31 images for sale, as part of “The Nature of Hope: 90 Years of Jane Goodall’s Impact” campaign that started on April 1, with the work of 10 more artists being released each week, according to the website of sale host Vital Impacts, a women-led, non-profit organization that uses art to support those protecting the planet.
“As we celebrate the extraordinary life and legacy of Jane Goodall, we not only honor her groundbreaking work in ethology but also recognize her pivotal role in inspiring women around the world,” National Geographic photographer Ami Vitale, the founder of Vital Impacts, said in a press release.
“Jane Goodall did more than just redefine our understanding of the relationship between humans and animals; she shattered barriers and opened doors for women everywhere,” she added.
Award-winning photographer Jody MacDonald, renowned wildlife photographer Tui De Roy and critically acclaimed photographic artist Tamara Dean are among those whose work is featured.
However, one of the most notable images is a self-portrait taken early in her career by Goodall herself, from a high peak in Tanzania’s Gombe Stream National Park when she was searching for chimpanzees below. She used a camera that she fastened to a tree.
The British animal behaviorist is known for her enduring and exceptionally detailed research on the chimpanzees of Gombe Stream National Park.

UK government under growing pressure to stop selling arms to Israel
Pressure is mounting on British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to suspend the sale of arms to Israel following the deadly attack on a convoy of aid workers in Gaza.
Calls for Sunak to stop supplying Israel with weapons grew after an Israeli airstrike on Monday killed seven members of staff from World Central Kitchen, three of whom were British citizens.
The government is still waiting for legal advice from its lawyers on whether or not selling arms to Israel is in breach of international law. Sunak is also under pressure to publish any legal advice he has been provided with on whether or not the Israeli government has breached international law through its actions in Gaza.
A recording emerged at the weekend of Alicia Kearns, who chairs the UK Parliament’s Foreign Affairs Select Committee, saying she is convinced the government has already received advice that Israel’s actions are illegal and has declined to publish it.

Who were the World Central Kitchen workers killed in Israel’s strike in Gaza?
Following the leak, Kearns stood by the report and said in a statement: “I remain convinced the government has completed its updated assessment on whether Israel is demonstrating a commitment to international humanitarian law, and that it has concluded that Israel is not demonstrating this commitment, which is the legal determination it has to make.”
The governing Conservative Party is historically supportive of Israel, but the killing of British citizens has shifted the domestic debate.
On Thursday, more than 600 lawyers, legal academics and former members of the British judiciary wrote to Sunak, warning him that “serious action” is needed to “avoid UK complicity in grave breaches of international law, including potential violations of the Genocide convention.”
“While we welcome the increasingly robust calls by your government for a cessation of fighting and the unobstructed entry to Gaza of humanitarian assistance,” the letter says, “simultaneously to continue (to take two striking examples) the sale of weapons and weapons systems to Israel and to maintain threats of suspending UK aid to UNRWA falls significantly short of your Government’s obligations under international law.”
The three main opposition parties, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, have all called for the suspension of arms sales to Israel if government lawyers say it is illegal, and have demanded that Sunak outline why it has not happened yet.
Sunak has taken a firmer line in recent calls with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to a government readout of a call that took place on Tuesday, Sunak said he was “appalled by the killing of aid workers, including three British nationals,” and demanded a “thorough and transparent independent investigation into what happened.”
The Downing Street release claimed Sunak said “far too many aid workers and ordinary civilians have lost their lives in Gaza and the situation is increasingly intolerable,” and that he “reiterated that Israel’s rightful aim of defeating Hamas would not be achieved by allowing a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza.”

Defense sales from the UK to Israel are “relatively small,” Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said earlier this week, when compared to the amount of weapons that come from the US and Germany. However, parliamentary estimates show that the UK has still licensed arms worth over $725m.
Diplomatically, it would be a significant step by a key Israeli ally and permanent member of the UN Security Council. It would also set Britain apart from a number of its allies, including the US and Germany, if it were to take the action unilaterally.
Suspending sales would be also politically difficult for Sunak domestically, as it’s likely not everyone in his own government or party would support him.
The family of one of the aid workers killed former Royal Marine James Henderson, have criticized the UK sale of arms to Israel. Speaking on their behalf, his brother told the Times of London that accountability was their “only hope of justice.”
“I don’t believe our government will hold the correct people to account, but I guarantee that our government will sell weapons to Israel, which may in turn be used to kill our fellow citizens.
“It’s hard to comprehend that.”

Donald Trump faced mounting trouble this week in his legal universe, with judges overseeing two of Trump’s legal cases refusing to accept his attempts to delay and toss the prosecution – and the former president doubling down on efforts to discredit his opponents.
The judge overseeing Trump’s criminal trial in New York expanded a gag order on Monday, which had originally banned Donald Trump from making public statements about court staff, trial witnesses or the families of any counsel or staff member on the case. The narrower gag order did not prohibit Trump from making statements about family members of the judge, and after Judge Juan Merchan issued it, the former president took to social media to attack the judge’s daughter.
“His Daughter,” wrote Trump on the social media platform Truth Social, “is a Rabid Trump Hater,” identifying her by name.
The new gag order would now prevent him from making statements like that – but Trump’s abusive commentary about her, and others involved with his trial has probably already prompted threats and harassment.
In a court filing revealed on Tuesday, Trump also motioned for Merchan to recuse himself from the case, alleging his daughter’s consulting work for Democratic clients was a conflict of interest.
“It can no longer be ignored that Authentic’s commercial interests are benefited by developments in this case,” wrote Trump’s lawyers in the filing.
This is the second time Trump has attempted to oust the judge over his daughter’s work; last year, an ethics panel reviewed a similar argument by Trump’s legal team but found Merchan’s daughter and her firm did not pose a conflict of interest.
Merchan denied on 3 April Trump’s last-minute attempt to delay the trial until the supreme court rules on presidential immunity claims that arising out of a separate case.
The trial – over Trump’s efforts to suppress a sex scandal ahead of the 2016 election by allegedly falsifying business records to conceal hush-money payments to the former stripper and adult film star Stormy Daniels – is set to begin on 15 April. It will be the first-ever criminal trial of a former US president.
Meanwhile, the US district judge Aileen Cannon rejected Trump’s attempt to throw out the case alleging he mishandled and illegally retained classified documents. Trump had argued he was entitled to retain the documents under the Presidential Records Act; Cannon rejected his bid to toss the case on grounds the charges “make no reference to the Presidential Records Act, nor do they rely on that statute for purposes of stating an offense”, she wrote.

Her finding nonetheless leaves open the possibility for Trump to use the theory that he had legitimately retained the documents under the Presidential Records Act, setting her on a collision course with the Department of Justice’s special counsel Jack Smith, who has called the Presidential Records Act theory a “fundamentally flawed legal premise” and said he would appeal to a higher court if the judge recognizes the theory.
Cannon has slow-walked the case over Trump’s alleged illegal retention of classified documents, which FBI agents uncovered at Mar-a-Lago in August 2022. Prosecutors hoped to begin the trial in July, but Cannon has not yet set a trial date, allowing Trump to postpone filing pre-trial motions required for it to commence.
That’s a win for Trump, who has sought to delay his numerous prosecutions ahead of the 2024 presidential election.Wrestler and actor endorsed president and Kamala Harris in 2020 but tells Fox News that for 2024 he will ‘keep my politics to myself’
The wrestler turned action star Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson dealt a blow to Joe Biden, saying he would not repeat his endorsement of the president in his looming rematch with Donald Trump.
Johnson endorsed Biden in his first contest with Trump four years ago, saluting the former vice-president and senator for his “compassion, heart, drive and soul”.
But in an interview with Fox News on Friday, Johnson said: “Am I going to do that again this year? That answer’s no. I realise now going into this election, I will not do that.”
Long the subject of rumours about his own political ambitions, Johnson reportedly fielded an approach from No Labels, the centrist group that now says it will not run a candidate against Biden and Trump.
Johnson has not disavowed talk of running for office. In 2021, after a poll showed public support, he said: “I don’t think our Founding Fathers EVER envisioned a six-four, bald, tattooed, half-Black, half-Samoan, tequila drinking, pick-up truck driving, fanny pack-wearing guy joining their club – but if it ever happens it’d be my honour to serve you, the people.”
Last year, he said the same poll led “the parties” to his door.
“That was an interesting poll that happened and I was really moved by that,” Johnson told a podcast. “I was really blown away and I was really honoured. I’ll share this little bit with you: at the end of the year in 2022, I got a visit from the parties asking me if I was going to run, and if I could run.
“It was a big deal, and it came out of the blue. It was one after the other, and they brought up that poll, and they also brought up their own deep-dive research that would prove that should I ever go down that road [I’d be a real contender]. It was all very surreal because that’s never been my goal. My goal has never been to be in politics. As a matter of fact, there’s a lot about politics that I hate.”
Johnson overcame that hatred in September 2020, when he endorsed Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris.
“You guys are both experienced to lead, you’ve done great things,” Johnson said.
“Joe, you’ve had such an incredible career, and you’ve led with such great compassion, heart, drive, and soul … Kamala, you have been a district attorney, a state attorney, a US senator. You are smart and tough. I have seen you in those hearings.”
Biden beat Trump convincingly but four years on, Johnson told Fox News: “Am I happy with the state of America right now? Well, that answer’s no. Do I believe we’re gonna get better? I believe in that – I’m an optimistic guy. And I believe we can do better.
“The endorsement that I made years ago with Biden was what I thought was the best decision for me at that time. I thought back then, when we talked about, ‘Hey, you know, I’m in this position where I have some influence,’ and it was my job then … to exercise my influence and share … who I’m going to endorse.”
Johnson also said his “goal is to bring this country together” but said he would “keep my politics to myself”.
“It is between me and the ballot box,” he said. “Like a lot of us out there, not trusting of all politicians, I do trust the American people and whoever they vote for that is my president and who I will support 100%.”Dina Boluarte has denied wrongdoing after being accused of illicit enrichment in relation to her use of at least three Rolex watches and designer jewellery
Peru’s president, Dina Boluarte, has dismissed an investigation into her use of luxury watches as a “smoke-screen”, denying wrongdoing and saying that the items had been loaned to her, though she admitted to journalists that it was a “mistake” to have accepted them.
Earlier on Friday she faced closed-door questioning by prosecutors which lasted nearly five hours, amid allegations of illicit enrichment linked to her use of at least three Rolex watches and designer jewellery that appeared inconsistent with her modest monthly presidential salary of about £3,320 ($4,200).
The president’s fierce denial comes just a week after police and prosecutors battered down the door of her home in a Lima suburb in a night-time raid searching for the watches. The Rolexgate scandal has embroiled her government in a political crisis and forced the unpopular leader to reshuffle her cabinet after abrupt resignations.
Boluarte, 61, is far from being the first Peruvian president to be accused of corruption but the allegations have done nothing to improve the reputation of a leader accused of presiding over the killings of 49 people by security forces during widespread protests over the ousting of her predecessor, Pedro Castillo, in December 2022. She faces a separate ongoing investigation over her role in those deaths.
In a televised address to the nation, Boluarte said she told prosecutors that the watches had been a loan from Wilfredo Oscorima, the governor of Ayacucho, a region in Peru’s southern Andes, whom she described as a “friend” and a “brother”.
She said all the watches except one had been lent to her by Oscorima, who she said had told her he hoped they would project a good image of the country if she wore them.
“It was an error to accept as a loan those watches from my friend,” she said, adding she had already returned those she borrowed.
“As these watches are not my property, I was not obliged to declare them in my declaration of assets and income,” she added defiantly. She went on to dismiss allegations that she owned a luxury designer bracelet and necklace, saying the items in question were costume jewellery she had owned for years.
Boluarte dismissed the investigation as a “lie” and a “smoke-screen” and called on prosecutors to be more professional, rather than following leads from the “tendentious press”.
She blamed her failure to clarify the situation earlier on her lawyer Mateo Castañeda, who sat next to her at the press conference. She said he had advised her not to address the country until she had dealt with the prosecutors.
Boluarte’s late response to the allegations, which emerged in mid-March, may do little to allay scepticism. The scandal began when La Encerrona, a popular Peruvian news podcast, analysed 10,000 images from the presidential Flickr account, revealing what appeared to be an undisclosed collection of luxury watches and jewellery.
The prosecutor’s office made no immediate comment following Boluarte’s testimony.Bernie Sanders ramps up pressure on White House: ‘My view is no more military aid to Israel when children [there] are starving’
More than three dozen congressional Democrats – including representative Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker and a key Joe Biden ally – signed a letter to the president and the secretary of state Antony Blinken, urging a halt to weapons transfers to Israel.
“In light of the recent strike against aid workers and the ever-worsening humanitarian crisis, we believe it is unjustifiable to approve these weapons transfers,” the letter said. It was signed by Pelosi and 36 other Democrats including Representatives Barbara Lee, Rashida Tlaib and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
Friday’s letter also calls on the US to withhold future arms transfers pending a US investigation into the airstrike on the World Central Kitchen humanitarian workers or if Israel “fails to sufficiently mitigate harm to innocent civilians in Gaza”.
On Thursday, hours after Biden told Israel to take concrete steps to protect civilians and aid workers in Gaza or risk losing military support from the US, top senators belonging to the president’s Democratic party ramped up pressure on the White House to go further.
The progressive senator Bernie Sanders was among the strongest voices. “Israel should not be getting another nickel in military aid” until it markedly facilitates the flow of provisions into a region that the US suspects is already grappling with famine, he said.
“We are looking at one of the worst humanitarian disasters that we have seen in a very, very long time … because Israel is not allowing the humanitarian trucks into Gaza, and especially into the areas where people are in most desperate condition,” Sanders told CNN on Thursday.
Adding that it was not the US’s job to worry about how Gaza may tie into the political future of the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, the Vermont senator added: “My view is no more military aid to Israel when children [there] are starving.”
Meanwhile, the Democratic senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland insisted that the president enforce a national security memorandum signed in February that aimed to condition the transfer of military weaponry to Israel on its adherence to humanitarian benchmarks.
“I was glad to see the president indicate that he’s going to monitor compliance and base US policy going forward on the government meeting these requirements,” Van Hollen told Politico Playbook. “That suggests no more ‘anything goes’ when it comes to policies towards the Netanyahu government.”
Topping the list of policies that Biden could leverage against Israel is the suspension of transferring “offensive weapons” to Israel if it fails at “reducing civilian harm” or “getting desperately needed assistance to people in need”, Van Hollen said. The senator alluded to that policy days after Israeli airstrikes killed seven employees of the international food charity World Central Kitchen (WCK). Following the attack, a cargo ship carrying 240 tons of food destined for Gaza returned to Cyprus.
The Massachusetts Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seek to impede the sale of F-15s to Israel after the killings of the WCK staffers, which included a US-Canadian citizen and three British nationals.
A day before the WCK workers were killed, a report surfaced that the Biden administration was mulling an $18bn arms transfer package to Israel that would include more than two dozen F-15 fighter jets.
“We cannot approve the sale of arms to a country that is in violation of our own laws on this,” Warren told CNN. “And that includes access to humanitarian relief.
“This is a moral question – it is also a legal question. Congress has responsibility here, and I’m willing to take that responsibility.”
Netanyahu has said Israel killed the WCK staffers unintentionally, and two senior military officers have been fired as a result.
Sanders, Van Hollen and Warren are all part of a 51-49 majority that Democrats – and independents who caucus with them – hold in the Senate.
Biden and his administration have generally stood in steadfast support of Israel, which has struck Gaza on land and by air after the 7 October attack by Hamas killed 1,100 Israelis and also took hostages. But with the death toll in Gaza climbing above 30,000 and the humanitarian crisis worsening, the US – which provides Israel with at least $3.8bn in security assistance annually – recently abstained from a United Nations vote which resulted in a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.
Biden on Thursday for the first time called for an immediate ceasefire, too.John Alfred Tinniswood, who was born in 1912 in Liverpool, acquired the title after Japan’s Gisaburo Sonobe, 112, died in March
An 111-year-old man from England is now the world’s oldest living man and says the only diet he follows is eating fish and chips every Friday.
John Alfred Tinniswood, who was born in 1912 – the same year the Titanic sank – insist the secret to his long life is “pure luck”. He obtained the title of world’s oldest man after 112-year-old Gisaburo Sonobe, from Japan, was confirmed to have died on 31 March.
Reflecting on his longevity, Tinniswood told Guinness World Records: “You either live long or you live short, and you can’t do much about it.”
Tinniswood, who is a great-grandfather, was born in Liverpool and now lives in a care home in Southport. Having become the UK’s oldest man in 2020, Tinniswood is unfazed by his newfound status as the oldest man in the world.
“Doesn’t make any difference to me,” he said. “Not at all. I accept it for what it is.”
Since turning 100 in 2012, he received a birthday card each year from the late Queen Elizabeth, who was his junior by almost 14 years. Giving advice for younger generations, he said: “Always do the best you can, whether you’re learning something or whether you’re teaching someone.
“Give it all you’ve got. Otherwise it’s not worth bothering with.”
He said that he gets a fish supper each Friday at the home, adding: “I eat what they give me and so does everybody else. I don’t have a special diet.
“If you drink too much or you eat too much or you walk too much, if you do too much of anything, you’re going to suffer eventually.”
Tinniswood can still perform most daily tasks independently – he gets out of bed unassisted, listens to the radio to keep up with the news and still manages his own finances.
He lived through both world wars and is the world’s oldest surviving male veteran of the second world war, as he worked in an administrative role for the Army Pay Corps.
In addition to accounts and auditing, his work involved logistical tasks such as locating stranded soldiers and organising food supplies.
A lifelong Liverpool FC fan, Tinniswood was born just 20 years after the club was founded in 1892 and has lived through all eight of his club’s FA Cup wins and 17 of their 19 league title wins.
When asked how the world around him has changed throughout his life, Tinniswood said: “The world, in its way, is always changing.
“It’s a sort of ongoing experience … It’s getting a little better but not all that much yet. It’s going the right way.”
He met his wife, Blodwen, at a dance in Liverpool and the couple enjoyed 44 years together before she died in 1986.
The oldest man ever was Jiroemon Kimura from Japan, who lived to the age of 116 years 54 days and died in 2013. The world’s oldest living woman and oldest living person overall is Spain’s Maria Branyas Morera, who recently celebrated her 117th birthday.Missile strikes in Ukrainian city followed up with further strikes as rescuers worked, says governor; 20 casualties reported in drone attack on Russia’s Morozovsk airbase. What we know on day 773
Russia fired five missiles on Ukraine’s southern city of Zaporizhzhia on Friday, killing at least four people, injuring 20 and damaging residential buildings and industrial facilities, the regional governor said. Two journalists covering the aftermath of the strikes were among those wounded in the city, near the war’s frontline. Ivan Fedorov, the governor, said: “First there were two missile strikes, and then, about 40 minutes later, there were other strikes at the same place – just as rescuers, police started working.” Reuters TV footage showed reporters rushing to help colleagues lying injured on the ground before emergency crews arrived.
A Ukrainian drone attack targeting the Morozovsk airbase in Russia killed or injured 20 members of airfield personnel and destroyed six Russian warplanes, as well as badly damaging eight others, according to officials in Kyiv. Russian defence officials, however, claimed they intercepted more than 40 Ukrainian drones and only a power substation was damaged in the barrage. Neither side’s claims could be independently verified. Morozovsk airbase is used by Russian tactical bombers that launch guided bombs at the Ukrainian military and frontline towns and cities, according to a Kyiv source.
Russian forces have taken control of the settlement of Vodyane in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk region, Russia’s defence ministry claimed on Friday. The ministry’s statement – the latest of several claimed advances by Russian forces since they took nearby Avdiivka in February – could not be independently verified. Earlier on Friday, Russia’s state-run RIA news agency cited an official as saying Russian troops had entered the suburbs of Chasiv Yar, farther north near Bakhmut. The Ukrainian military denied Russian advances in the town.
Russian investigators claim to have found pro-Ukraine data on the phone of one of the Moscow terror attack suspects, despite evidence that an Islamic State offshoot was responsible. The data showed that on the war’s second anniversary in February he had trawled for photographs of the Crocus City Hall and sent it to others, Russia’s investigative committee alleged, also saying it found photos of men in camouflage holding the Ukrainian flag. Human rights experts have warned that any statements from the suspects should be met with scepticism as the men appeared to have been tortured.
Pro-Russian separatists in Moldova claimed an explosive drone hit a military base, without causing injuries or major damage, three weeks after an allegedly similar incident. The strike was in Rybnitsa district, 6km (3.7 miles) from the Ukraine border, the region’s ministry for state security said on Friday. “The target was a radar station that suffered minor damage. A group of investigators is on-site,” it added, without directly blaming Ukraine.
A Russian governor was hospitalised after being stabbed, a spokesperson has said. Andrey Chibis, governor of far northern Murmansk, was stabbed in the stomach on Thursday evening outside a cultural centre in Apatity town, where he had been holding a meeting. Chibis said in a video posted on Telegram from his hospital bed early on Friday that he had “come around” after surgery and that doctors had saved his life. Chibis was sanctioned by the EU in 2022 over his support for the Kremlin’s Ukraine offensive.
Authorities in Russia’s eastern city of Khabarovsk declared a state of emergency in an area where a “radiation source” was found, according to Russia’s Tass news agency. It said elevated radiation levels were detected near a power pylon about 2.5km from residential buildings. Nobody had been injured or exposed to radiation so far and radiation levels would be monitored for the next two days, it said.
The Kremlin has called the French president’s assertions that Russia plans to disrupt the coming Paris Olympics “absolutely unfounded”. Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday he had “no doubt” that Russia would target the Games this July and August.
The UK foreign secretary will travel to the US next week and urge politicians to approve a $60bn package of aid for Ukraine which Republicans have held up for months. David Cameron said on X (formerly Twitter): “Britain has put forward its money for Ukraine this year, so has the European Union. America needs to do it.”
Doctors Without Borders said a Russian missile strike on Ukrainian-held Pokrovsk had “completely destroyed” its office in the town. The humanitarian organisation said on X that it “condemns this attack on the office, which supports its emergency medical humanitarian assistance”.
Japan has announced new sanctions against Russia, banning exports of 164 goods to Russia including automobile engine oil and optical equipment. The trade ministry is also expected to ban imports of Russian nonindustrial diamonds.A jury found that Do Kwon and Terraform Labs misled investors before the collapse of the company’s namesake cryptocurrency
A jury in Manhattan found a Singapore-based former crypto CEO liable on civil fraud charges on Friday, agreeing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission that both he and his firm misled investors before the 2022 collapse of the company’s namesake cryptocurrency wrecked cryptocurrency markets.
The jury delivered the verdict in federal court after a two-week trial after hearing closing arguments earlier in the day. Terraform Labs founder Do Kwon did not attend the trial, as he has been detained in Montenegro since March 2023. He was intercepted while on his way to Dubai on the lam from authorities in multiple countries, traveling using forged Costa Rican travel documents.
The SEC accused both Terraform and Kwon of duping investors in 2021 about the stability of TerraUSD, a stable coin designed to maintain a value of $1. The regulator also alleged both had falsely claimed Terraform’s blockchain was used in a popular Korean mobile payment app. The regulator is seeking civil financial penalties and orders barring Kwon and Terraform from the securities industry.
Laura Meehan, the SEC attorney, said during closing arguments that the platform’s success story was “built on lies”.
“If you swing big and you miss, and you don’t tell people that you came up short. That is fraud,” Meehan said.
Louis Pellegrino, an attorney for Terraform, told the jury on Friday the SEC’s case relied on statements taken out of context and that Terraform and Kwon had been truthful about their products and how they worked, even when they failed.
“Terraform is still out there, trying to rebuild and make purchasers whole,” he said.
Kwon, who was arrested in Montenegro in March 2023, did not attend the trial, which began 25 March. Both the US and South Korea, where Kwon is a citizen, have sought his extradition on criminal charges.
Montenegro’s top court is evaluating the competing calls for his extradition. Kwon’s attorneys have advocated for extradition to South Korea in hopes of a lighter sentence. However, Montenegro’s government plans to approve extradition to the US, Bloomberg reported.
Kwon designed the cryptocurrencies TerraUSD and Luna, a more traditional token that fluctuated in value but was closely linked to TerraUSD.
The SEC estimates investors lost more than $40bn on the two tokens combined when the TerraUSD peg to the dollar could not be maintained in May 2022.
Their collapse also dragged down the value of other cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, and caused wider havoc in the crypto market, leading several companies to file for bankruptcy in 2022.
Terraform itself filed for bankruptcy protection in January.
The SEC has said Kwon and Terraform secretly arranged to have a third party purchase large amounts of TerraUSD to prop up the price when the stable coin slipped from its peg a year earlier, in May 2021. Kwon falsely attributed the recovery to the reliability of TerraUSD’s algorithms, according to the regulator.
Terraform’s attorney said on Friday that Terraform had disclosed TerraUSD’s peg needed to be defended in May 2021. He said the Korean payments app had used the company’s blockchain, but the technical details of how it did so were not important to investors.
US financial regulators have been keen to crack down on shady crypto moguls in recent months. Ex-FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried was sentenced to 25 years in federal prison for wire fraud and conspiracy to launder money late last week. His company is still in the thick of contentious bankruptcy proceedings.
Gurbir Grewal, director of the SEC’s division of enforcement, said in a statement Friday: “The defendants caused devastating losses for investors and wiped out tens of billions of market value nearly overnight. For all of crypto’s promises, the lack of registration and compliance have very real consequences for real people. As the hard work of our team shows, we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance.”Complaint accuses 26-year-old Christian ‘King’ Combs of assault aboard yacht chartered by music mogul father in December 2022
The music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs and his 26-year-old son Christian “King” Combs are both named in a lawsuit that accuses the younger man of sexual assault onboard a yacht in December 2022.
The suit, filed in Los Angeles superior court on Thursday and first reported by Rolling Stone, accuses the younger Combs of assault, battery, sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The elder Combs, who is facing several lawsuits alleging sexual abuse and was recently subject to federal raids in a sex-trafficking investigation, is accused of aiding and abetting.
The 31-page complaint on behalf of 25-year-old Grace O’Marcaigh describes events aboard the yacht chartered by Sean Combs for a family trip to St Martin in December 2022. The trip was “sold as a wholesome family excursion” but, according to the suit, turned into a “hedonistic environment”, with suspected sex workers and other celebrities brought on board.
O’Marcaigh, who worked as a bartender and the only onboard steward for the yacht, alleges that in the early hours of 28 December, Christian Combs pressured her to drink a shot of tequila that she “quickly suspected” had been spiked with drugs. Combs allegedly prevented her from leaving and forced her to perform oral sex on him.
The lawsuit further claims that a video of the younger Combs groping and kissing O’Marcaigh was filmed by Rodney “Lil Rod” Jones, a music producer who himself filed a lawsuit against the elder Combs in January alleging sexual assault and forcing him to hire sex workers. The complaint also includes photos of bruises on O’Marcaigh’s forearm where Christian Combs allegedly grabbed her.
O’Marcaigh claims she escaped Christian Combs when a fellow yacht employee purposefully looked for her because she had been gone a long time. According to the suit, she informed the boat’s captain about what had happened, but the incident was not investigated. O’Marcaigh believes that is because Sean Combs paid the captain to keep everything quiet.
Since the alleged incident, O’Marcaigh has suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and her severe suicidal ideation, according to the complaint. She seeks unspecified damages.
Aaron Dyer, an attorney for both men, dismissed the suit in a statement as “another lewd and meritless claim from Tyrone Blackburn”, the lawyer representing O’Marcaigh and Jones. “This complaint is filled with the same kind of manufactured lies and irrelevant facts we’ve come to expect from Blackburn,” the statement continued, noting that a federal judge in New York criticized Blackburn for “improperly [filing] cases in federal court to garner media attention, embarrass defendants with salacious allegations, and pressure defendants to settle quickly”. Dyer said he would be filing a motion to dismiss O’Marcaigh’s claim.
The lawsuit is the latest in a series of legal troubles for the influential music mogul, who just last year performed with Christian at the MTV Video Music Awards as he received a global icon award as part of a long-gestating music comeback. In November of last year, Sean Combs settled a lawsuit with his longtime ex-partner Cassie, a day after the singer’s explosive complaint detailed years of alleged rapes, physical abuse and sex trafficking by the rapper. A separate lawsuit accused Combs and two other men of gang rape in 2003, when the anonymous plaintiff was 17.
And in late March, federal homeland security officers and other law enforcement officials raided Combs’s properties in Los Angeles, Miami and New York as part of a sex-trafficking investigation by federal authorities in New York. Christian and his elder brother Justin were detained during the raid in Los Angeles but later released.
Sean Combs has denied all accusations, promising to “fight for my name, my family and for the truth” in a statement posted to X. His attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit accusing him of gang rape, saying he “never participated in, witnessed or was or is presently aware of any misconduct, sexual or otherwise, relating to plaintiff in any circumstance whatsoever”. Following the allegations, Combs resigned as chair of Revolt, the digital media company he co-launched in 2013, and his Hulu reality show was cancelled.

An earthquake shook the densely populated New York City metropolitan area on Friday morning, the US Geological Survey said, with residents reporting they felt rumbling across the eastern seaboard in what is a relatively rare event for the region.The government agency reported a quake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.8, with a preliminary location for the epicenter given as near Lebanon, New Jersey, and later as near Tewksbury and Whitehouse Station, all three of which are in Hunterdon county roughly in a 10-mile radius.
People reported feeling the quake in the states of Connecticut and Massachusetts, with the Weather Channel reporting that it was noticeable in Boston and residents in Philadelphia reporting they felt it, too. Tremors lasting for several seconds were felt more than 200 miles away near the New Hampshire border.
Over a dozen aftershocks were reported in the ensuing hours in the region, including a 4.0-magnitude quake early on Friday evening, according to the USGS.
The fire department of New York said on Friday there were no initial reports of damage or injury. But city dwellers were shocked and a little shaken up by the unexpected event, during which people sitting at desks or at home in high rises felt their whole building shake mildly for several seconds.
Camille Lewis was at a cafe in New York City when she felt the shaking.
“I haven’t been in an earthquake in New York and honestly I was scared that something was happening. I’m glad that the building I was in held up and honestly, I’m just glad that everybody is safe,” she said.
Lewis went on: “I was like, ‘Do I need to get under a table?’ Everybody was looking around, wondering what was going on. It lasted for a while. Definitely weird.”
The movement then passed but people were left jittery about aftershocks and busily checking in with friends and family, including children at school, briefly putting a high load onto cellphone networks, the city authorities reported.
The New York police department’s deputy commissioner of operations, Kaz Daughtry, said in a statement: “While we do not have any reports of major impacts at this time, we’re still assessing the impact.”
The UN security council was meeting at its headquarters in New York to discuss the situation in Gaza when the earthquake hit, shaking the building.
“New Yorkers should go about their normal day,” said the mayor, Eric Adams, but the governor, Kathy Hochul, said in a press conference that the quake was felt as far away as Baltimore, Maryland. “This is one of the largest earthquakes on the east coast to occur in the last century,” she said.
“Everyone should continue to take this seriously” in case of aftershocks, she added.
Planes were grounded at New York’s JFK and New Jersey’s Newark international airports and arriving flights were delayed. East coast train services were slowed but not canceled and New York City public transit continued running.
Hochul’s office reminded residents that “while highly unusual” the earthquake was not an isolated event as New York sites on geological fault lines. The tremor was felt to varying degrees across New England and south in Pennsylvania and Maryland, including in Baltimore, where Joe Biden was expected on Friday afternoon to tour the damage of the major bridge that collapsed there, blocking the port, 10 days ago.
Among those taking Friday’s earthquake in their stride was Roisin Brady, 36, an English teacher at a Manhattan private school. She said her students are going to write poetry about the earthquake.
Brady and her students had already planned to use the upcoming solar eclipse as material for their poetry unit. But the latest earthquake is another rare phenomenon for her middle school pupils to write about.
Brady was in her bedroom of her fourth-floor Brooklyn apartment when the earthquake happened, working remotely on student reports. Her boyfriend was in the kitchen, shouting to Brady about the glassware that was vibrating.
She noticed the clothes in the couple’s wardrobe were shaking. She then realized that the buildings across the street were shaking, too.
“It was just so surreal,” said Brady, of Glasgow, Scotland. “To see my boyfriend’s clothes all hanging out, and then swinging was just such a surreal experience,” she added.
The shaking stirred memories of the 23 August 2011, earthquake that jolted tens of millions of people from Georgia to Canada. Registering magnitude 5.8, it was the strongest quake to hit the east coast since the second world war. The epicenter was in Virginia.
That earthquake left cracks in the Washington Monument, spurred the evacuation of the White House and Capitol and rattled New Yorkers three weeks before the 10th anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks.
Meanwhile on Friday, the official social media account of the Empire State Building reassured its fans:
I AM FINE
James Pittinger, the mayor of Lebanon, New Jersey, near the quake’s epicenter, said there were no reports of injuries or significant damage but that people were unnerved. “I was sitting in my home office when things started to fall off the walls and shelves,” Pittinger said. “It was a crazy experience.”
Earthquakes in the eastern US are felt across a far broader area because the bedrock is much older and harder, transferring seismic energy more easily, according to the USGS. The rocks in the western US are younger and contain more faults that absorb earthquake energy.
Reuters contributed reportingClass-action settlement covers people required to take off religious attire by NYPD after Muslim women said their rights were violated
New York City agreed to pay $17.5m to settle a lawsuit by two Muslim women who said the police violated their rights after arresting them, by forcing them to remove their hijabs before being photographed.
The preliminary class action settlement covers men and women required to remove religious attire before being photographed. It was filed on Friday in Manhattan federal court, and requires approval by the US district judge Analisa Torres.
Payouts will total about $13.1m after legal fees and costs are deducted, and could increase if enough of the more than 3,600 eligible class members submit claims. Each recipient will be paid between $7,824 and $13,125.
The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed in 2018 by Jamilla Clark and Arwa Aziz, who said they felt shame and trauma when police forced them to remove their hijabs for their mugshots the previous year in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively.
Both had been arrested for violating orders of protection that they called bogus. Their lawyers likened removing the hijabs to being strip-searched.
“When they forced me to take off my hijab, I felt as if I were naked,” Clark said in a statement provided by her lawyers. “I’m not sure if words can capture how exposed and violated I felt.”
In response to the lawsuit, New York’s police department agreed in 2020 to let men and women wear head coverings during mugshots, so long as their faces could be seen.
“This settlement resulted in a positive reform for the NYPD,” said Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for the city’s law department. “The agreement carefully balances the department’s respect for firmly held religious beliefs with the important law enforcement need to take arrest photos.”
The new policy extended to other religious headwear, including wigs and yarmulkes worn by Jews and turbans worn by Sikhs.
Police can temporarily remove head coverings to search for weapons or contraband, but in private settings, by officers of the same gender.
Albert Fox Cahn, a lawyer for Clark and Aziz, said the accord “sends a powerful message that the NYPD can’t violate New Yorkers’ first amendment rights without paying a price”.
People forced to remove head coverings between 16 March 2014 and 23 August 2021 are eligible for the settlement.NSW premier says rising flood levels present ongoing danger for some communities, including in western Sydney
Sydney may have woken up to blue skies on Saturday, but flood levels were continuing to rise across parts of New South Wales with evacuation orders issued after an overnight deluge broke rainfall records.
Suburbs on the city fringes were facing the threat of significant flooding after copping more than a month’s worth of rain while a major landslip in the Blue Mountains left one community cut off.
The premier, Chris Minns, called for caution, noting just under 4,000 volunteers “spent the night in the cold and windy and rainy conditions, saving people’s lives”.
Warragamba dam, which holds most of Sydney’s water supply, reached full capacity and began spilling early on Saturday morning – two days earlier than predicted.
Levels at the dam were expected to peak at midnight on Saturday, but the New South Wales State Emergency Service commissioner, Carlene York, said communities along the Hawkesbury-Nepean river system would be “feeling that for the next few days”.
Evacuation orders were issued by the SES for 11 locations overnight on Friday and Saturday morning, including along the Hawkesbury-Nepean, low-lying parts of Chipping Norton in western Sydney and North Narrabeen on the northern beaches.

“While it looks like blue skies across Sydney at the moment and the emergency rain situation seems to be easing … it is important to note that flood levels in some of the rivers, particularly in western Sydney, are continuing to rise and that presents a danger for some communities,” Minns told reporters on Saturday.
The Bureau of Meteorology’s Steven Bernasconi said three rivers were likely to continue to rise, including the Hawkesbury at North Richmond, which was at moderate flooding but could see major flooding on Saturday afternoon.
Bernasconi said the Hawkesbury River at Windsor and the Colo River were also predicted to continue to rise, despite the deluge moving southwards.
The rain and wind threat was “contracting to the south-east”, he said, with “the coast and ranges down in the south of NSW … areas like Moruya and Narooma” receiving most of the rain.
The SES was involved in 152 flood rescues by Saturday morning, including 72 in metropolitan Sydney, and had received more than 4,000 calls for help over the past 24 hours.
Some parts of Sydney were hit with 200mm of rain, with Darks Forest in the Georges River basin hit with a 229mm deluge in 24 hours.
The Cooks River burst its banks at Earlwood after 7am on Saturday, triggering road closures and early morning traffic.
Bernasconi said the situation was easing with heavy rainfall starting to move out into the Tasman Sea.
But flash flooding and landslips remained a concern for Wollongong, the Illawarra and the south coast with two people reportedly taken to hospital after a home at Mt Kiera washed into a creek.

In the Blue Mountains, a landslip on a primary access road left a community cut off with authorities scrambling to arrange food drops.
“It’s the only access in and out of the valley,” Mike Davis, the owner of nearby vineyard Megalong Creek Estate, said.
“A lot of people are down here camping or in Airbnb’s at the moment so they need to do something fast.”
Around 40,000 homes and businesses lost power over the past 24 hours with fallen trees and powerlines further interrupting supply, Ausgrid said in a statement.
York said the SES was working with communities affected by the evacuation orders and would dedicate resources in southern parts of the state.
Up to 150mm of rain remained possible within a six-hour period for areas stretching hundreds of kilometres from the Blue Mountains to Narooma.
“The areas of our priority at the moment are … towards Wollongong, Illawarra and down into the south coast as this system continues to move down the coast and hopefully very soon out to sea,” York said.
Heavy rainfall and possibly severe thunderstorms were also battering southeastern parts of Queensland on Saturday and were expected to continue throughout the weekend.
Surfers and other beachgoers were warned to stay “well away from the surf and surf-exposed areas” due to dangerous conditions, particularly at east-facing beaches.

Hamas laid a trap and he walked right in
Six months after the attacks of 7 October, and it’s time to count again the losses. They begin with the dead, with the 1,200 Israelis killed on that day and the estimated 33,000 Palestinians killed in the 182 days since. Some are sceptical of a Gaza figure that comes from a health ministry controlled by Hamas – while others suspect those numbers are, if anything, an underestimate, fearing that many thousands of uncounted Palestinian dead lie under the rubble.
Then you have to reckon with those who were neither Israeli nor Palestinian, but outsiders who wanted to help and paid for that kindness with their lives – like six of the seven aid workers of World Central Kitchen who were killed in three separate strikes from an Israeli drone this week.
But the tally of suffering does not end with the dead. It must include the pain of maimed and orphaned Palestinians, and of the 134 Israelis and others who have spent the past six months held hostage, many presumed to be imprisoned underground, with some tortured and sexually abused.
The accounting of all that agony could last a lifetime and still it would not be enough. But any audit of this vicious half-year has to go wider still. The impact of the six-day war of 1967 is felt to this day, marking out the territories that remain under Israeli occupation. So what might be the lasting consequences of this six-month war? Who will emerge weaker and who stronger?
At first glance, you might assume Hamas would be disappointed by the results of its murderous efforts on 7 October. It had high ambitions: this week, a former Gaza official revealed that the Hamas leaders were so convinced “that they were going to bring Israel down that they started dividing Israel into cantons, for the day after the conquest”. (They approached that ex-official to be a canton governor.) It did not pan out that way. Instead, Hamas’s rampage through southern Israel brought hellfire down on the people of Gaza, provoking an Israeli response that has left a staggering 2% of the population dead and displaced the rest.
That scale of destruction won’t unduly trouble the zealots at the top of Hamas: the death of others is a sacrifice they are willing to make. But they will lament the losses among their own: an estimated 10,000 men, more than a third of their fighting force, along with three battalion commanders and seven members of the ruling political bureau, according to Michael Milshtein, the former senior intelligence officer widely regarded as Israel’s foremost expert on Hamas. The group has lost or used up almost all its arsenal of rockets – and, its greatest disappointment, the action failed to spark the wider regional onslaught against Israel it dreamed of.
And yet, Hamas will regard itself as anything but the loser in the six-month war. For all of Benjamin Netanyahu’s talk of the “total defeat” of Hamas, it is still standing. Most of its key Gaza leaders remain alive and present; it is still “the prominent actor in Gaza”, Milshtein told me, adding that there is no realistic prospect any of the mooted alternatives will take its place. Despite all that the people of Gaza have endured, their approval of Hamas’s role in the war stands at 70%, according to the veteran Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki.
Still, the chief source of the satisfaction Hamas will be feeling, six months on from 7 October, lies elsewhere – not in what’s happened to it, but rather in what’s happened to its mortal enemy: Israel.
In the immediate aftermath of 7 October, the country enjoyed widespread – though not universal – sympathy, especially from western governments. Joe Biden rushed to Tel Aviv, to sit with the bereaved and to stand with their leaders. But look at the picture now.
Israel has never been more isolated. The president of the United States, which for decades has been Israel’s genuinely indispensable ally, is so “outraged” – his word – at Israel’s killing of those aid workers that on Thursday night he issued a barely veiled ultimatum to the country’s prime minister: do as I say or there will be no more arms. The threat is hardly empty: other western allies have already cut off weapons supplies or are considering it.
Those governments are responding to a global mood they can no longer ignore. Because it’s not Israel’s perennial critics who are denouncing the country; it’s Israel’s friends. In Britain, the WCK killings saw Lord Ricketts, a former UK national security adviser who earlier served Tony Blair, demand a suspension of arms sales. His call was echoed throughout the Conservative party, in a letter from hundreds of lawyers, including several former justices of the supreme court, and by usually pro-Israel, right-leaning voices in the media. When you’ve lost Nick Ferrari, who can regularly be seen acting as MC at major UK Jewish charity events, you know you’re alone.
Some in Israel will hope the current outrage is narrowly focused on Monday’s appalling incident. But that’s not quite right. For one thing, the conduct that led to those seven deaths is hardly a one-off – it’s just that this time the victims were not all Palestinian. As the much-admired defence analyst Amos Harel wrote in Haaretz this week, the WCK killings are “a symptom of a broader phenomenon” in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF), a carelessness or worse “when it comes to shooting near civilians” and “a serious discipline problem” that has led to “many violations of the laws of war”.
For six months, Israel has asked for the world’s understanding, trying to explain that it faces an exceptional enemy – one that hides underground, among and underneath a civilian population, and thinks nothing of firing rockets and missiles from hospitals, schools and mosques. For that reason, foreign governments have granted Israel a rare patience. But that has now run out. And much of it comes down to the decisions Israel took not on combat, but on aid.
Even those allies who, like Biden, accepted that Israel’s war on Hamas would come at an unbearably heavy price could see no logic or justification in a pattern of restrictions and obstacles that inflicts suffering not on Hamas, but on ordinary Palestinians. Anger at the shortages of food and medicine, at the warnings of an avoidable famine, reached breaking point following Monday’s killings. After Biden’s demarche, Netanyahu promised to change and to open new aid crossings into Gaza – though there was a promise of a “flood” of aid from Israel last month, and it never came.
The result is that Israel, whose founders longed to be a light unto the nations, stands today as a leper among the nations. Many Israelis are barely aware of the change: their media don’t show the war the rest of the world sees and deplores. They are focused instead on the threatened retaliation from Tehran, which could come at any moment after Israel’s assassination of two Iranian generals in Damascus earlier this week, and the looming peril of Hezbollah’s arsenal across the northern border. And, frozen by the failure to bring the hostages home – the focus of growing anti-Netanyahu protests – they remain caught in the trauma of 7 October, replaying the horror of that day, the deadliest in Israel’s history, over and over again.
I don’t blame the Israeli public for that. But I do blame their leaders. Even if they did nothing to address the root causes of the conflict, their job was to transcend the rage and terror of that moment, to think calmly and strategically even amid the panic. To realise in that moment that their fight was with Hamas, not the entire population of Gaza. Instead, they have sown hatred in the hearts of a new generation, and they have made lonely a country that cannot function alone.
So, no, there are no winners in this dreadful war. But Hamas can enjoy a wicked smile of satisfaction: it laid a deadly trap – and Benjamin Netanyahu led Israel right into it.

From Oregon to California, blankets of alien-like blue creatures are washing up on rocky beaches. They are Velella velella, tiny colonies of organisms with a sombrero-esque fin sticking out the top and tentacles dangling down.
Millions have been spotted along the US west coast this spring, much to the surprise and delight of beachgoers who have gleefully posted footage on social media. Some call it a “blue tide” and it happens most springs – but not always to the same degree of abundance.
Though they look like one organism, velella – also known as by-the-wind sailors – are actually colonies of creatures from a class called hydrozoa that use the wind to speed along. They spend most of their lives out in the open ocean, searching the water column below them with tentacles that sting fish larvae or zooplankton, but are harmless to humans. One part of the colony is responsible for eating, another for reproduction. Coral is another colonial organism – but it’s uncommon to encounter such colonies on land, says Anya Stajner, a doctoral student at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
There are a few theories about how the animals got their brilliant blue color. Living at the interface of the air and ocean doesn’t offer them many places to hide from predators such as the huge mola mola ocean sunfish, which sucks up velella like candy. Their color might help them disguise themselves by blending in with waves, Stajner says. Another theory is that the color protects them from harsh UV rays – a sort of built-in sunscreen.
Velella live for months and travel widely around the Pacific gyre, says Julia Parrish, a marine biologist at the University of Washington. Typically they travel down the coast of California to Central America, then shoot out past Hawaii to Japan and return again, skimming along the surface like a kite surfer.
The creatures go through boom-and-bust cycles during this journey, experiencing many different life stages, “which are all quite different from each other”, says Parrish. When there is a lot of food in the water column for them, their population explodes and they wash to shore together, which often happens in the spring and sometimes in the fall.
Despite people encountering them often, velella are actually not widely studied in science – partly because of how they live. Marine biologists have been very successful in figuring out how to raise jellyfish in tanks, for scientific research and for the public to see up close. But velella live on the ocean’s surface and have many forms through their lifespan, and scientists haven’t quite solved the problem of how to create the conditions to raise them in captivity. That means we know less about them than we do about most jellyfish that live underwater, far from human eyes.
One current area of study is the relationship between velella and ocean temperatures. In 2021, Parrish used data collected from 20 years of citizen scientists’ observations to uncover the patterns in the mass strandings of velella, and found that the events were more likely to happen when winters were warmer than usual.
The reasons why are still being investigated, but Parrish thinks it has something to do with rough winter seas. “In really stormy winters with very high waves sustained over multiple days, as in storm events, those colonies that are just small and just starting to develop are going to be torn apart,” Parrish says. “But in a milder winter, they’re going to have a higher chance of survival, leaving more of the colonies towards the end of the winter to really grow up.
“That’s our hypothesis,” she adds, but proving it would take a major effort to study the organisms out at the continental shelf.

Since the little sailors are ephemeral in nature, they don’t follow the same patterns every year. But when they do show up in mass numbers, it usually happens in multiple places at the same time, Parrish says.
When they come ashore, the blanket of shiny blue creatures creates a magnificent tableau for photographers and beachcombers – but as they dry out, the creatures lose their color and become “like crunchy potato chips or candy wrappers”, Stajner says. They also play a role in bringing carbon and nutrients that would otherwise have been in the ocean to the shores where they are blown.
Beachgoers love them because they are cute, shiny and instantly recognizable, and because they come in such huge numbers. But admirers may not realize they are actually looking at colonies of creatures that are struggling and dying, Parrish says. “Instead, what you see is something that is beautifully colored, small enough to be harmless and it’s just so odd and interesting,” she adds.
As the world’s oceans continue to warm as part of the climate crisis, it’s likely that more velella colonies will come to shore, and also thrive out at sea. It makes scientists such as Parrish wonder if these charismatic little blue-hatted creatures could have a more complex impact on the oceans than we realize. For instance, since velella eat zooplankton, fish larvae and especially fish eggs, they may begin to negatively affect fish species.
“There’s some evidence that collectively there are enough hungry velella out there that they can actually change the population dynamics of some of the forage fish like anchovies that are also found in the California current system,” Parrish says.Richard Grenell’s shadow foreign policy campaign is unsettling diplomats and threatens to collapse US interests
For Donald Trump, he is “my envoy”, the man apparently anointed as the former US president’s roving ambassador while he plots a return to the White House.
To critics, he is seen as “an online pest” and “a national disgrace” – and most importantly, the dark embodiment of what foreign policy in a second Trump administration would look like.
Meet Richard Grenell, vocal tribune of Trump’s America First credo on the international stage and the man hotly tipped to become secretary of state if the presumed Republican nominee beats Joe Biden in November’s presidential election.
A senior executive in the rightwing Newsmax cable channel, Grenell, 57, has crafted a persona as the archetypal Trump man, keen and ever-ready to troll liberals, allies and foreign statesmen in public forums and social media.
Grenell – who served as a rambunctious ambassador to Germany and acting director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term – has carved a niche as the articulator-in-chief of a Maga approach to global affairs that appears to echo his political master’s voice.
Seasoned analysts fear his hyperactivity is already unsettling US diplomats even while Trump is out of office.
In recent months, he has pitched up in Guatemala, where he tried to stymie US state department pleas for a peaceful transition of power by backing rightwing efforts to block the inauguration of the liberal president-elect, Bernardo Arévalo, on supposed electoral fraud grounds about a poll previously declared “free and fair” by international observers.
Arévalo subsequently took office, but not before Grenell lambasted American diplomats for “trying to intimidate conservatives” over “a phony concern about democracy”.
He has also repeatedly visited the Balkans – building on a previous role as the Trump administration’s special envoy to the region and working on property deals in Serbia and Albania with Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.
He attempted to broker a meeting between Trump and Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan at last year’s United Nations general assembly in New York at a time when the Turkish leader was blocking Sweden’s bid to join Nato, although the proposal was subsequently rejected amid security concerns.
Grenell’s high profile has an intimidating effect on serving US diplomats, according to Fulton Armstrong, senior fellow at American University’s Centre for Latin American Studies.
“Grenell’s very cunning and effective. Having penetrated both the intelligence and the policy world, he knows who can be seduced, intimidated and destroyed,” Armstrong, a former senior analyst at the CIA, told the Guardian.
“The state department eventually did the right thing in Guatemala but only after a lot of dawdling and this tells Grenell that it has issues of commitment and allegiance [that he can exploit].
“Weak people at the state department are scared to piss off the right wing because they want to be ambassadors and fear for their careers, which makes them vulnerable. Someone like Grenell knows how this can be used for issues favoring Trump.”
For his part, Grenell has accused the state department of “playing politics” and “pushing leftwing ideas” in Latin America.
Addressing the influential CPAC gathering of conservatives in February, he said US foreign policy cried out for an “SOB diplomat”, a role he apparently envisions for himself.
“What we need right now is diplomacy with muscle,” Grenell told an online video debate last summer on the Balkans hosted by the pro-Trump America First Policy Institute. “We need to stop mocking tough diplomats. What we’ve seen with Ukraine is that when diplomats fail, we have war and conflict.”
Grenell has become a strident advocate of abandoning negotiations in decades-old territorial disputes in the Middle East and the Balkans in favor of trade and economic agreements that he hails as sidestepping political problems through creating jobs.

“The success that Donald Trump had was that he avoided politics and concentrated on the economy,” he told CPAC. “Young people leave the region because they don’t have help and they don’t have a job. So part of our foreign policy, if we want to solve problems, is to avoid the political talk and figure out ways to do greater trade.”
For detractors, such talk is code for a transactional foreign policy tailored to Trump’s personal and business interests at the expense of America’s traditional democratic alliances – as well as a signal that Ukraine would be pressured to surrender territory to end its war with Russia.
“There are many aspects to what Grenell is doing,” said Joe Cirincione, a veteran Washington foreign policy and arms control specialist. “One is grift, looking for business deals, particularly in Serbia, where Trump has longstanding business interests and Trump seems to be helping him pursue this.
“Another is more sinister. It looks as though Grenell is trying to build up a developing authoritarian network of rightwing leaders to form this authoritarian axis that Trump might govern by – ranging from Putin to [Viktor] Orbán [prime minister of Hungary] to Erdoğan.
“All these are anti-democratic forces and use the simple playbook of using democracy to overthrow democracy.”
Grenell’s own pronouncements give proponents of America’s existing alliances little cause for comfort.
A relentless critic of Germany’s financial contributions to Nato, he trolled Sweden’s prime minister, Ulf Kristersson, when he attended Biden’s State of the Union address in January to mark his country’s accession to Nato, a move Grenell had opposed, purportedly on the grounds that it would not pay its way.
“The leader of Sweden, who currently isn’t paying his fair share of Nato obligations but has promised to do it later, is leaping to his feet to applaud Joe Biden and the far Left spending policies Biden wants to enact,” Grenell posted on X.
The comment echoed Grenell’s crockery-breaking spell as ambassador to Berlin, where he infuriated his hosts on arrival by demanding that they renew sanctions on Iran after Trump withdrew the US from the nuclear deal agreed by Barack Obama’s administration – even though Germany still adhered to the agreement.
He also ruffled German feathers by telling Breitbart that part of his ambassadorial role was “to empower other conservatives throughout Europe”, a comment seen by some as a tacit olive branch to the far-right Alternative for Germany (AFD) party.
For figures like Cirincione, such rhetoric is a harbinger of worse to come.
“If Trump were president and Grenell secretary of state, it would set back American interests by decades, collapse the development of the democratic west and assist the rise of the global right wing, no questions about it,” he said.The Australian author is ‘incredibly influential’, but has had to survive decades of ‘cultural cringe’ and genre snobbery to make finally ‘a decent sort of living’
Before parched and dusty towns across Australia became full of fictional sinister people; before the explosion of outback noir and all the mega book deals, starry adaptations and international bestseller lists that came with it; before all these things reached critical mass, there was Garry Disher.
For decades, he has been quietly working away, writing his polished, masterful crime novels in the shadows. Always anxious about money, relying on public lending rights and side hustles like writing workshops and teaching jobs.
It has been the slowest of slow burns: three decades of intricate plotting and accomplished, fully realised work before he could claim his rightful place as a bestselling novelist with the publication of his 2019 novel, Peace. Now 74, having written 60 books in 43 years, Disher says, “It’s only in the last 10 years that I’ve made what I could call a decent sort of living”.
There has always been respect for Disher, but not always recognition outside the crime cognoscenti. “He’s the crime writer’s crime writer” says author Michael Rowbotham, who has sold 8.5m books. “He’s the crime writer that other crime writers read. He’s incredibly influential.”
“It has always puzzled me as to why he wasn’t recognised more widely,” says Sue Turnbull, crime fiction expert and senior professor of communication and media at the University of Wollongong. “He’s always been a brilliant writer. He’s certainly in the same league as Peter Temple and Peter Corris.”

Before the world discovered that the Australian landscape could be as captivatingly harsh, moody and threatening as the people who populate it – such an atmospheric antidote to malevolently quaint English villages or American prairie badlands – Disher says there was “a kind of cultural cringe that if it is Australian it can’t be good enough and if it is crime it is therefore junk fiction. Certainly those prejudices existed and I only sold in small quantities for most of my working life. Most people bought Michael Connelly and Ian Rankin or Ed McBain.”
And yet, he adds: “I have never wanted to do anything else.”

The scope and breadth of his work is remarkable, though given his prolific output, as he says, “I’d go very stale if I wrote the same sort of book over and over again.” There has been literary fiction: his 1996 novel The Sunken Road was nominated for the Booker prize but “sank without a trace in Australia,” he says. There have been seven Challis and Destry mysteries, following Detective Inspector Hal Challis and Detective Sergeant Ellen Destry; these are set on the Mornington Peninsula where Disher lives on a quiet dirt road, a place, he says, of “extremes of rich and poor people. ”
Then there are four crime novels in the Hirsch series, where Constable Paul Hirschhausen runs a one-cop station near the arid Flinders Ranges; this is where Disher grew up and “it still tugs on my imagination.” There are all the stand-alone novels, and eight novels in the Wyatt series, following the titular professional thief who Robotham calls “one of the most captivating characters in crime fiction.”
Disher’s latest novel, Sanctuary, follows another thief, Grace, who specialises in snatching small, high-value objects and, using her own outlaw morality, steals from people she thinks deserve to be robbed. Grace appeared as a minor character in one of the Peninsula novels, but “she kept tapping me on the shoulder in intervening years, wanting a story of her own,” Disher says.
With so many books under his belt, what does he do to counter accidental repetition? “I don’t check, but I am aware that it is possible it could happen,” he says. “My girlfriend has found my use of the term ‘the smell of toxins in the air’ in three books now. So it’s a tiny thing.”
He is an inveterate collector of newspaper clippings, sometimes sitting on them for years before they are ready to be in a book. For Days End, he spent years taking notes about “Covid deniers, anti-vaxxers, the rise of far-right movements”; for other books “the whole concept will come to me when I have just been walking on the beach”.
He writes his first draft by hand with a blue ballpoint pen on the back of old manuscript pages: “There’s a certain superstition. I make asterisks and notes for myself. In the afternoon I will type what I wrote in the morning and by then I’m already editing it.”
His novels are busy, a complete world in themselves. Yes, there are capers and car chases, but they are multilayered, full of humanity, nuanced, evocative of place and covering the panoply of alarming social issues.
“What I think I am doing,” Disher says, “is not just writing another crime novel which has got a certain formula. I am not so much interested in the tropes of crime fiction, as I am in the characters and the sorts of strain they are under.”
So why did it take Disher decades to break through? It is not enough any more to simply write one good book, or even 60: many authors will spend weeks on the road, going from town to town across the country when a new book is published to spruik it. Authors are expected to be personalities now, Rowbotham explains: “You’ve got to be very engaging and entertaining. You have got to be able to give a great soundbite on a radio show and tell an interesting anecdote to entertain the festival crowds. Garry is charming and has got a great sense of humour, but he is a shy man. He doesn’t enjoy that part of it.”
“I’m not a natural,” Disher admits. “I’m not a warm and cuddly figure. I get really nervous every time – speaking to you, live on radio, in writers festivals. I do find it hard.” He’d much prefer to let his books do the talking.
“I’d love it if my adoring fans would just flock to the bookshops,” he adds. “But it doesn’t happen that way. There has to be some publicity. But I’d rather not.”
Even so, Disher isn’t giving up the day job. “I think I’m getting better as a writer,” he says. “I’ll keep writing for as long as my mind keeps working. I might have to rely on friends to tap me on the shoulder and say, ‘you know, you’re losing it.’”

A scorched-earth policy after a breakup might seem like the quickest option for some. But for others, it’s worth the effort to keep things sweet even when the romance has soured. Whether the motivation is shared children or pets, cost-of-living concerns or simply liking the person even if things didn’t work out as lovers, readers shared overwhelmingly positive experiences about staying friends with an ex.
While the transition came quite naturally for some, the consensus is it takes work and that each “post-dissolution friendship” is as unique as the reasons the former couple came together in the first place.
Readers agreed that time, boundaries and the right intentions were the keys to success.

Our relationship and connection, while short, gave me my spark back; she was so very kind, tender and wise. And I think it was good for her too, for a time.
After we broke up it took at least six months to consider friendship. It was her suggestion that we might start hanging out platonically and she was very clear with no mixed messaging. It seemed like a risk worth taking.
A year on I still have occasional internal conflict about it, but if I start lurching into emotional grey areas I take a break and recalibrate. It’s important to interrogate your motives: are you in the friendship for the right reasons and can you be a true friend? I find a philosophical approach helps enormously.Kat, Australia
After 12 years of marriage my wife and I have finally called it quits but we can’t really afford to move out and live on our own. We have a functional friendship, but it is awkward. Neither of us has a good reason to hate each other. We just fell out of love. Critically, it’s too expensive to go our separate ways so we’re making do for the time being. I’d still consider us best friends, but we’re just flatmates now. Who knows how it will pan out longer term, but not being jerks to each other helps. Nothing good ever comes from being a jerk.Anonymous, Australia
If you have genuine love for a person, romantic feelings can change into friendship and respect with a bit of time. Breaking up can bring out the worst in people, but if you can accept your part in it, it allows more compassion for the other person.
Twenty years ago I broke up with a long-term boyfriend from Italy. Although I was hurt at the time, I was able to acknowledge that we had both behaved badly and were equally responsible for our relationship ending. It takes a while to be able to be real friends – for us it was almost 10 years. Early on we had disastrous breakup sex and then stayed in contact but continued to fight occasionally. Once we got it out of our systems we realised that we love each other as people.
I have met his wife and child; he has met mine. My daughter loves him and thinks he is hilarious. Our friendship is no threat to our current relationships. I cannot imagine not knowing him or having him as a friend.
Of course, if your partner has been an absolute toad, be done with them.Brigid, Australia
After a long-term partner and I broke up decades ago, we wanted the best for each other. We had mutual friends, were close with each other’s family and loved each other. On the advice of a counsellor we had a complete 12 months of no contact after the breakup. We were able to meet up again after that with less angst and more understanding.
We’ve been very good friends for the last 23 years. I’m like an uncle to her kids and we socialise often with my partner and hers. When she had her first child I felt very emotional. I ended up not having kids and it prompted me to think about what I wanted and whether that was a factor in our breakup.
Remaining in each other’s lives has worked with some caveats. Your current relationship should always take precedence. Although my partner gets on with my ex, there’s a limit to how much interaction is acceptable and I understand that if the shoe was on the other foot I wouldn’t be as happy. A friendship with an ex can seem loaded due to shared history and the intimacy so it’s important to be firm about boundaries.Anonymous, Australia
Letting your ego get in the way of relationship “conversion” is shortsighted. It’s natural to get bitter and to feel sorry for yourself when a relationship ends, but it will only make your pain worse.
I was devastated when my husband of 30 years left me to be on his own. More than half my adult life had been shared with him.
It isn’t always easy, but focusing on the goodness in an ex is ultimately in your best interest. Losing my marriage was the hardest thing I have had to endure. Forgiving my husband, supporting him and maintaining our family unit have made me happier. I couldn’t bear the thought of us not being able to stay friends.Anonymous, Australia

If you’re uninhibited and prone to monologues about your pelvic floor, you’re a Samantha. If you’re a narcissist who’s knee-deep in Klarna loans for your RealReal purchases, you’re a Carrie. And if you subscribe to the revisionist take that Miranda’s pragmatic, no-nonsense approach to life makes her an unsung hero of feminism – then your choice is obvious.
Any woman with a television has at some point in the past two decades played “which Sex and the City character are you?” I’ve met self-proclaimed Carries, Samanthas and Mirandas. But very rarely does one ever meet a willing Charlotte.
And why would they? She’s the most maligned of the foursome. Sex and the City was a groundbreaking show that revolutionized TV’s portrayal of what it means to be a single woman. But Charlotte, a prim gallerina whose sole aspiration consists of locking down a Wasp husband, remained a bridge to the past. Her prudishness was a foil to the sexploits of her more adventurous friends. She’s “Park Avenue Pollyanna”, a killjoy and moralist who literally runs away from the table when a playful brunch conversation turns to the topic of how semen tastes.
All six seasons of Sex and the City launched on Netflix this week, spawning many think pieces with writers worrying that gen Z cannot “handle” the watch. After all, this is a show that’s long been criticized for its lack of diversity, offensive portrayal of LGBTQ+ characters, and out-of-touch class politics. These writers fear that, much like Charlotte, gen Z takes itself too seriously to understand that comedy is a product of its time that usually doesn’t hold up years later.
But as a gen Z elder who has watched the entire series no less than four times, I would like to say that this is unfair. Despite generalizations about my cohorts being too sensitive for even the slightest discomforts of adulthood, I have full faith in us to understand that times were different 26 years ago. We can handle it.
Having said that, I think my generation’s read on the show will be different. For millennials, Miranda was always the coolest of the foursome. But for gen Z, I think Charlotte is finally going to get her due. In many ways, my generation has been saying “I’m a Charlotte” even if they don’t know it. Here’s why:
She’s a foremother of “quiet luxury”: There’s an aspirational gen Z trend of dressing richly, but not ostentatiously. Think stealth wealth: Sofia Richie wearing a simple white – but expensive – Prada dress on a summer day, or a TikToker romping around Paris in the $1,130 Toteme scarf jacket. Charlotte, similarly, idolizes old money glamour, signaling her status in understated Ralph Lauren, Oscar de la Renta, and Vera Wang – all very desirable these days. Every day was a weekend at the country club for Charlotte. She didn’t need to splash sartorially like Carrie in her tutus or deliberately dress down à la Miranda’s proto-normcore. Your coastal grandmother wishes she could flex that subtly.
She’s a prude: Charlotte has her share of sexcapades – she’s the only one of the main four who admits to performing “tuchus-lingus”, justifying this by the fact that she’s only done it under the sanctity of marriage.
But overall, many of her bedroom antics, or lack thereof, are framed as Victorian. She hates blowjobs and waits to have sex with her first husband until they’re married.
That’s all fodder for jokes about her virtue. So-called “Puriteens” are generally having less sex, delaying the age we start, and eschewing the type of hookup culture Samantha Jones enjoyed in favor of fewer partners.
She’s a horse girl: Charlotte is proof that if you ride out a dorky trend long enough, it’ll become cool. Sex and the City was filmed when Central Park still had an operating stable. In season two, Charlotte pays the location a visit in an attempt to get over her childhood fear of horses. (She was thrown from one named Taddy.)
More than two decades later, gen Z reclaimed the archetypical “horse girl”. Once a term for the type of pony-obsessed middle schooler, it’s now a bona fide aesthetic, with Stella McCartney building a collection around the theme, tapping the gen Z model Kendall Jenner to pose naked on a white steed.
She’s a trad wife: Charlotte’s wifely ambitions clashed with the third-wave feminism of the show’s heyday. She’s essentially an Upper East Side trad wife who quits her job upon marriage to throw herself into a strenuous life of townhouse decorating and party planning.
Sounds a lot like those stay-at-home girlfriends you see perform their days on TikTok, rejecting a life at the office for a leisurely existence of midday Pilates classes and sponcon housework, all funded by an off-camera benefactor. Gen Z has long flirted with these “trad-wife” pretensions, boasting about their lack of ambition and hated for their full-throated embrace of gender roles.
She’s actually a good friend: According to the Washington Post, 55% of gen Z and millennials say friendship is more important than a romantic partner. Reminds me of wise (and show-defining) words that came not from SATC’s lead Carrie, but its underestimated backbone, Charlotte: “Maybe our girlfriends are our soulmates and guys are just people to have fun with.”
This is a woman who volunteered to plan Miranda’s baby shower while she was dealing with her own infertility issues. She gave Carrie her engagement ring, the last reminder of a marriage that ended painfully, so it could be sold for a down payment on her apartment – because, whoops, Carrie spent all her money on shoes.
And lest we forget, when Charlotte did get pregnant and ran into Big at a restaurant during her last trimester, she screamed so hard at the guy for breaking Carrie’s heart that her water broke. If that’s not a ride-or-die, I don’t know what is.
This article was amended on 5 April 2024 because Charlotte gave Carrie her engagement, not wedding, ring, and it was for a down payment, not to pay rent as an earlier version said.From Ikea storage to the benefits of a solidly built table, architects from Paris to Tokyo share their tips and philosophy for living beautifully in smaller spaces
Australia has some of the largest homes in the world. Many who do live small aspire to one day live big. But around the world, limited space is not always seen as a sacrifice.
From Sweden, where the average size of an apartment is 68 sq metres, to Hong Kong’s micro flats as small as 18 sq metres, globally architects are used to getting creative with tight spaces – they must let as much light in and offer individuals and families the same flexibility as a larger home.
Demands for affordable housing in Australia, and the rising cost of living and building globally, has seen an increase in alternate living arrangements from granny flats, to van life to the tiny home movement. But small living doesn’t have to be microscopic. So how does the world live small well?
Architects Patricia Carrasco and Ricardo Mancho have lived in their 55-sq-metre apartment for the last five years. They say it is the “best house ever.”
“We wake up every morning and say we live in the best house in the world,” says Mancho.
The apartment’s living and sleeping areas are separated – the bathroom and bedroom are set back from the kitchen and open plan living, but the use of glass and floor-to-ceiling balcony doors allow natural light to reach every room, while curtains offer flexibility and privacy. Corridors function as storage for shoes and other household items, while plants fill the balconies and hang from the ceiling.
Mancho and Carrasco say that all this can be done cheaply: most of their cupboards and storage are from Ikea. Discarded materials from construction sites were used to make some furniture, like a marble slab that is now their coffee table.
“Why this house is really good, even though it’s not really big, is because of its flexibility” says Carrasco.
For the few times a month when friends visit, bedside tables can brought into the living room as extra seating and the TV moved aside. “When we do yoga, we move the furniture around, and it really gives us freedom in a small space.”
The couple’s apartment is in one of Madrid’s “corralas”, dating back to the 1860s. With inward-facing patios, windows and doors facing inwards, which often remain open encouraging neighbours to talk throughout the day.
There are some sacrifices to be made. The couple would like an air fryer, but they don’t have the bench space. They have a one-person coffee machine to reduce clutter. But living small, they say, has made them live within their means.
“When I was a kid, I had a really big house with my family. I thought that my house had to be like that … and I really thought that I had to have a wardrobe for the plates … the kind of plates that you only use once a year.”
The size of the average home in Spain is growing and bigger homes are desirable. But cost and a desire to be in Madrid’s city centre has Spaniards in the capital sticking to 60 to 70 sq metres dwellings.
The couple are about to upgrade to a 90-sq-metre apartment, so their home can double as an office and have room for a future family. But they say this is their limit.
“If your house is 250 sq metres, that means that there is almost no density in your area,” says Mancho.
“If we have smaller houses, we have more density and density gives you everything … I work, and I have a place to buy bread, I say hello to the person selling flowers, I talk to people, I have an interaction with them. We love our neighbourhood.”
For architect Bertille Bordja, giving a second life to the historic buildings of Paris is a welcome challenge at her Ovo Studio business.
“Every corner, every centimetre in Paris especially, and in France, is precious,” says Bordja.
“We have a big history, so lots of buildings and old stones.”
Apartments in Paris are about 40 to 45 sq metres on average. Bordja says many Parisians are willing to sacrifice space to be in the city centre, where apartments are often in or next to iconic 19th century Haussman buildings that dominate the city.
Bordja commonly removes large corridors taking up valuable square metres, instead creating a thicker wall to house inbuilt storage, but maintaining the division of space and isolating noise. She also embraces open-plan kitchens and living areas to let light in.
Bordja says even though living smaller is normal, families in particular are always trying to find ways to squeeze in more space, and she encourages clients to think about the whole space, floor to ceiling.
“They ask, every time, for the famous third room, in the two bedroom apartments,” she says.
“I say, ‘you will have the third room, but maybe it is only eight sq metres, but it’s OK, it will work’. I work more with volume than with sq metres … eight in volume is very different.”
She always tries to use sustainable materials, often multiple times, throughout an apartment while maintaining the character of the space. Heritage buildings can have layers of structural problems under the surface, but Bordja says new developments made with cheap materials are not always easier to design for.
“It is very important for some French people to renovate, to take care of these buildings,” says Bordja.
New York City is the most densely populated city in the US. In the historic, desirable suburbs of Manhattan, apartments are an average of 50 to 60 sq metres.
The founder and principal architect at MCKA, Michael Chen, says that there is “a spirit” to those who want to live in cities and smaller spaces.
Chen became known for designing small almost 10 years ago, when he took 36 sq metres and created the “five to one” apartment – a custom-built, fold-out, multi-use space.
“One thing about designing for small spaces is thinking about time and how the space evolves over the course of the day,” says Chen.
“There is a degree of motion and transformation that happens from morning to night.”
Demonstrating what Chen calls the “choreography” of living, the apartment’s sliding storage unit creates the ability to close away day or night “rooms” as required. Transforming a dressing room to a sleeping space to an open plan living space, the “zones of overlap” feel spacious, separate and deliberate.
Chen says he also hopes such designs allow for living small can be done with grace.
As well as using custom-built, highly engineered and malleable solutions to tight spaces, Chen extols the virtues of a particular piece of traditional furniture: the table.
Another design trick he suggests is leaving some space empty, which allows for “visual and spatial relief”.
As prices rise in boroughs like Manhattan and Brooklyn, Chen says people are rethinking the way they live in their apartments, and “planning in place” for families instead of relocating.
“The idea that multiple people might be in a small space, means you need to allow for coordination and privacy.”
A city of 13 million, Tokyo is the most populated prefecture in Japan, where the average home is about 65 sq metres. At Unemori Architects, architect Ryosuke Koizumi says the smaller plots in the city force architects to think differently.
“I believe that thinking about spaces with extremes, such as light and dark, openness and closure, stretches the range of human perception,” says Koizumi.
Unemori project House Tokyo, built in 2019, has a total floor space of 50 sq metres despite being built on a 26-sq-metre block.
A house for two, it sits in a dark, narrow alley, but is full of light thanks to building upwards – a semi basement level for the bedroom leads up to an entrance, before the kitchen and dining areas on the first floor.
Above them, large windows and various ceiling heights make the home feel expansive, bringing natural light from multiple sides.
Like Hong Kong, Tokyo is also known for micro apartments, starting at just nine sq metres, but small spaces often mean that more time is spent out in the community.
“They frequently bathe in a nearby public bath. That’s why there is no bathtub in this house” he says.
Building upwards is also common. Views of the sky, neighbouring houses and streets means homes have a unique relationship with the space around them. In Tokyo, creating new shapes creates the uneven landscape the city is known for.
The founder of Never Too Small, Colin Chee, says small apartments in Australia are often seen as dark and dingy.
Chee bought a 37-sq-metre apartment off the plan in 2007. A year and a half later, he was shocked to find his flat was cramped, dark and narrow. But stripped of brand new, ill-fitting wardrobes and replaced with Ikea furniture, floor-to-ceiling storage and mirrors, it became his home.
He recently upgraded to 40 sq metres – what he calls the sweet spot – where he now lives with his partner and his dog.
But Chee says Australia places too much emphasis on size, over quality.
“My mum used to say … you cannot judge the quality or the nutrition of the food by the size of the plate,” says Chee.
Chee says that Never Too Small has inspired people to pick up on hacks for small living. Pick the right furniture (chairs with skinny legs and low backs keep the space open), choose sliding doors and curtains over permanent walls and add mirrors where they will reflect natural light.
Also in Melbourne, Chee says the Cairo flat is one of the best examples of how high ceilings, dividing curtains and multi-use spaces can make a small apartment sing. In the heritage listed 1930s art deco Cairo flats, one of the first examples of medium density housing in Australia, surrounding vegetation and a courtyard offer both communal space and a green aspect for all apartments.
But Chee says new blocks in Australia typically don’t have shared spaces that encourage interaction, and restrictive floor plans and minimum standards for cubic metres of (often pre-built) storage make apartments hard to adapt.
In contrast, many apartments in Asia are “shells” when bought, allowing for more flexibility, as well an ability to respond to cultural norms, including the arrangement of the living space for prayer or a large entryway where shoes are left.
Architecture videographer and the creative founder of Simple Dwelling, Anthony Richardson, says, “There’s a really strong misconception that minimalism is empty, cold, white rooms.
“A simple home can have texture, it can have life and warmth to it … so many houses that are touted as minimalist are often quite excessively large … but when you really break it down, minimalism is about the essentials.”
Richardson says existing suburban terraces can be poorly oriented, but skylights and creative ceiling design can let the light in, while using textures like timber, brick and concrete can create warmth in small spaces.
But the biggest challenge in Australia is that small is seen as a backwards step.
“I think so many people would choose a larger, poorly designed house over a smaller, more refined, beautiful house just because of the size.”
“Everyone just thinks about resale, resale, resale.”I held it and nothing happened. So I just took it, put it in my bag and left
I was an art student in Santiago, Chile, when I was invited to the National Museum of Fine Arts for a private event in June 2005. I had some drinks and needed the bathroom, which was downstairs.
On the way, I went into a very dark room – I couldn’t even see the palms of my hands. Then, unknowingly, I walked into Rodin’s Torso of Adele, a small sculpture that is just 11cm high and 37.5cm wide. When I touched it, it was cold. It was the first time Rodin had been exhibited in Chile.
I didn’t even think – it was now or never. I held the work in my hands, and nothing happened. So I just took it, put it in my bag, and left feeling excited and emotional.
I had previously thought of taking an artwork from a museum to see how the public would react. Theft is all across this country – Chilean politicians have been plundering for years. So I thought: why not explore theft almost as if it were an artistic intervention, and see what happens next? My life at the time was quite punk. I was in a rock band and interested in radical artistic ideas.
I hadn’t thought specifically of taking the Rodin, it was just a general idea. That night, all the factors combined to make me do it. There was no alarm, no cameras.
I went home and poured myself a glass of wine. I began to sketch the sculpture on my easel. I saw Rodin’s signature on it. It was spectacular, and I felt so fortunate, an observer of a great story. After a few hours of sketching, I went to bed and slept well.
The next day was cold, damp and cloudy. I turned on the television and saw the news. It was chaos. It was the biggest news story in Chile: a work had been taken from the National Museum of Fine Arts.
That’s when I began to fear the legal implications. I went to the police station to return the Torso of Adele and, at first, told them I had found the sculpture in the park. I never wanted to be in the middle of the action – I just wanted to see what would happen next. But I decided it wouldn’t make sense to lie, so I later told them I was a student, and that this was an artistic action. The officer said, “That’s brilliant.”
I spent the night in a holding cell. There, one policeman told me I had stained Chile’s reputation. But I never regretted anything. There were concerns the work was damaged, and they checked that it was fine. But I was not going to destroy an artwork – I treated it carefully.

When the police went to my house, I showed them a document on my computer where I had written down early plans to take an artwork, with the phrase: “Loss returns the memory of something that is not there.” In a world full of content, I wanted to explore the idea of, rather than bringing something into a museum, doing the opposite. After I took the sculpture, the exhibition was suspended and later reopened without the Torso of Adele, but many people still queued to see the empty plinth. I like to think people in Chile are closer to the piece because of what I did.
The legal fallout was long and uncomfortable. I had to speak to lawyers, prepare my case, and eventually go to court. Journalists would wait outside my house to take pictures of me. At the hearing, the judge agreed that my action was art. That was fantastic, though I had to spend 10 months volunteering for six hours a week in the library of Santiago’s main prison.
My action divided people at my university. Some supported it, others didn’t. They suspended my studies, so I went to a different university. There I met a fantastic artist who became a mentor to me.
Nearly 20 years on, at the age of 38, I am at a more mature stage of my artistic life. I am still creating art, under a pen name of sorts; I’ve made photography that explores the concept of death, and I’m creating a conceptual book with blank pages and hidden texts. I’ve been invited to exhibit some of my work in Argentina. I won’t say too much, but it’s an installation featuring whites on top of whites, tied to the concept of absence. I’ve always been fascinated by that, but I am not interested in taking anything else from a museum – for now.

A key element of Masters intrigue exists outside the ropes. Will Greg Norman and Yasir al-Rumayyan appear at Augusta National next week? It has become increasingly futile for golf’s establishment to ignore LIV and its Saudi Arabian backers but Augusta’s custodians are extremely precious about potential distraction from the first major of the year.
If Norman and the governor of the Saudi Public Investment Fund are spotted under the famous oak tree at the Masters it will serve as the latest indication of the normalisation or legitimacy LIV has craved since it was merely a PowerPoint plan. This has been the most expensive foot-in-the-door project in sporting history; LIV continues apace in year three with $25m (£19.8m) events, even before the hundreds of millions spent on coaxing players in the first place is considered.
The Masters, given power and standing, should be playing a key role in elite golf’s potential unification rather than fretting about uncomfortable conversations on the clubhouse lawn. LIV is not going away. The head of a sovereign wealth fund is fundamentally more important to this sport now than Tiger Woods.
A notable absentee from this LIV stop in Doral is the property’s owner. Two years ago, Donald Trump played in the pro-am here while making frequent jibes about Joe Biden’s lack of golf ability. Trump has been in West Palm Beach this week but has failed to make the short trip to Miami. His book, The Art of The Deal, remains for sale at $28 in the club shop.
Trump branding is front and centre elsewhere; from ping-pong balls to mugs and T-shirts. Yet the man himself, normally such a fan of golf-related publicity, isn’t here. One gets the impression LIV’s tournament staff are far from upset about that. Doral staged LIV’s team championship last October. Quite deliberately, there will be no 2024 repeat; the same window would be close to the US election.
Doral’s recent history feels intrinsically linked to the chaotic state of men’s professional golf. It was a host venue for a World Golf Championship, a series of events created in part to fend off a rebel tour plan fronted by Norman in the 1990s. Sergio García spat in a hole here. Rory McIlroy flung an iron into a lake; only for it to be retrieved and put up in the clubhouse bar by Trump.
By the time the 45th president became too hot for the PGA Tour to handle, the WGC was shifted to Mexico City. The tournaments no longer exist but Norman’s dream, funded by endless petroleum pounds, later took off. Trump seized the opportunity to get his own back on the PGA Tour by welcoming LIV with open arms. Trump’s close links to Saudi Arabia have raised eyebrows in the US.
“I think it’s the first big boy golf course we’ve played this year,” said Brooks Koepka, in what can be taken as a dig at the lack of bite supplied by venues elsewhere. Yet it is also true LIV works best outside the United States. Galleries this week are nowhere near the level that used to attend the WGC. They are, however, noticeably younger. Amateurs paid thousands of dollars for a pro-am appearance.
Speaking to media in his native Australia this week, Norman predicted 30,000 people each day will attend LIV’s upcoming stop in Adelaide. “The journey has only just started,” said an emboldened Norman. He says he has a timeframe in his own mind to walk away from this business. Norman revealed he takes calls from industry leaders in other sports on a weekly basis. This tallies with the rising theory Saudi’s PIF will look to make inroads into other mainstream US sports. The Strategic Sports Group, which has completed a business deal with the PGA Tour and also wants PIF involvement, looks an obvious vehicle for that.
Tournament organisation is clean and efficient, a situation explained in part by the number of experienced golf executives who have, like players, switched to LIV. The playing of 54 holes and absence of early starts renders this a caddie’s dream but those outdoor butlers insist they are treated far more fairly than was ever the case on traditional tours.

“Everyone now feels far more comfortable in their own skin out here now,” said one experienced bag man. That, too, is readily apparent; gone are anxious glances or once common complaints about unfair media coverage. The likes of Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter and García took the brunt of that negativity. By the time Jon Rahm, the Masters champion, signed for LIV in December the majority of people shrugged. Rahm was spared moral outrage.
There are competitive issues. LIV’s failure to command world ranking status – Norman had told players this would be resolved – has a negative impact on those seeking to participate in majors. Talor Gooch, for example, has played in the last two Masters but is not eligible for next week’s edition after slipping to 550 in the world. Some golfers do not like playing the week before Augusta; in this domain, they have no choice.
That a number of LIV players fall out of contract, along with whispers about new LIV teams at the end of this year, should worry the PGA Tour. Scope for new arrivals means scope to continue a talent drain from a circuit that recently had to stage its marquee event, the Players Championship, without household names. McIlroy this week bemoaned a fall of 20% in PGA Tour television audiences; the Northern Irishman rightly acknowledged LIV’s viewing figures are hardly impressive either but this emphasises how golf’s fractured state is no particular use to anybody. Whether casual golf fans tune in to the Masters or have been suitably turned off by infighting and money obsession remains to be seen.
“I’m putting my trust in Yasir on where the game is headed more globally,” said Phil Mickelson. That’s Yasir, not anybody involved in pre-existing tours or governing bodies. One explanation for that is that the PIF can write the biggest cheques. Mickelson’s deliberate language, though, illustrated how golf has been turned on its head. The scene at Doral is testament to that.For every Prey or Blade Runner 2049 there are a dozen uninspired retreads of beloved old sci-fi franchises. So a Matrix reboot may not be the best news
Somewhere over the digital horizon, down the rabbit hole and straight on til morning, a new Matrix episode is brewing. After handing us three deeply average (at best) sequels to the majestic original 1999 film, studio Warner Bros has decided to hand the keys of the Nebuchadnezzar to Drew Goddard, whose writing credits include The Martian, The Cabin in the Woods, and Cloverfield. It’s probably a good idea, because the series’ creators, Lana and Lilly Wachowski, have clearly run out of ideas if 2021’s completely superfluous The Matrix Resurrections is anything to go by (although to be fair, Lilly did not even get involved in that one).
Resurrections joined the ranks of belated sequels to science fiction and fantasy totems that never quite live up to the standards of the original, yet somehow still keep coming. Next year we are due a new Tron movie, Tron: Ares, which will star Jared Leto, Gillian Anderson, Evan Peters and Greta Lee. These are all actors who have done fine work, and director Joachim Rønning is an Oscar nominee who made a passable effort on 2017’s Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, yet there is at least a 50% chance the movie will carry all the cultural weight of a new Lighthouse Family album. There is also a new Alien movie in the works, which does at least look promising. And it can only be so long before somebody in LA drags Arnie out of retirement for one last Terminator retread.
How many times have we seen these films enter the limelight with a flurry of promotional activity, raising the desperate hopes of ravening fans before the inevitable bad reviews kick in and the unfortunate entry slips sheepishly through the back door of the Odeon fire escape, never to be seen again? Terminators three, four and five (six was OK); Alien vs Predator; Prometheus; nearly every movie with Star Wars in the title since the original trilogy … I feel as if I have spent half my life hoping these episodes would recapture the wonder of the films that inspired them in the first place, only to be disappointed when it becomes clear something is missing. It’s the hope that kills you.
And yet every few years, a sequel comes along that bucks the trend: a Prey or Blade Runner 2049, which opens up the creative architecture and makes us believe again. And this is the best we can look forward to, because unwanted new follow-ups to genre classics will seemingly always keep coming, for the same reason that each a brand of McDonald’s or Burger King is much less likely to fail than the wonderful new independent bistro that just opened up down the road.
Perhaps, if we’re lucky enough, the new Matrix movie will be one of these outliers. Goddard is at the very least an ideas man, rather than the kind of hired Hollywood hand who often taking charge of these sequels. And that is clearly what the project needs. The world imagined by the Wachowskis in 1999 was an endlessly open creative sandbox, but clearly it needs a major revamp if it is to have any credibility a quarter of a century on.
Goddard’s first task is to work out exactly what the essence of The Matrix is. Is it the screen chemistry between Keanu Reeves’s Neo and Carrie-Anne Moss’s Trinity? Evidence from the lukewarm reaction to Resurrections would suggest not. And yet if Goddard junks the original cast entirely in favour of all-new adventures in the real and digital futures, how does he do so without basically writing off the last three movies? We were always told Neo might not be “The One”, but if it turns out he actually isn’t, then a hell of a lot of screen time would seem to have been wasted.Perhaps the film-maker could pull an old Hollywood trick and bring back the one Matrix alumnus who didn’t make it into the most recent sequel: Laurence Fishburne. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who replaced the venerable actor as a younger version of Morpheus, failed to capture the imagination, and if Goddard does plan to feed off nostalgia, there is no one better to capture the spirit of the original 1999 entry. On the other hand, Resurrections’ failure to resonate with audiences hints that if there really is anything left to be harvested from this aching old sci-fi franchise, it is probably not more glossy-eyed nostalgia. If we’re really going to get excited about taking the red pill once again, the director might be better off choosing a different rabbit hole altogether this time around.Letitia James’s lawsuit accuses JBS of deceiving customers about being climate-friendly – and the implications could be far-reaching
When the office of the New York attorney general, Letitia James, announced that it would be suing the world’s largest meat company, JBS, for misleading customers about its climate commitments, it caused a stir far beyond the world of food. That’s because the suit’s impact has the potential to influence the approach all kinds of big businesses take in their advertising about sustainability, according to experts.
It’s just one in a string of greenwashing lawsuits being brought against large airline, automobile and fashion companies of late. “It’s been 20 years of companies lying about their environmental and climate justice impacts. And it feels like all of a sudden, from Europe to the US, the crackdown is beginning to happen,” said Todd Paglia, executive director of environmental non-profit Stand.earth. “I think greenwash[ing] is actually one of the pivotal issues in the next five years.”
Research suggests that citizens are increasingly demanding more sustainably produced goods, and big businesses are taking note. But rather than actually changing their practices, many instead turn to messaging that falsely implies their products are better for the Earth than they actually are in order to keep customers happy.
That’s what the attorney general has asserted that JBS – a parent company that owns brands and subsidiaries like Swift, Certified Angus Beef, Pilgrim’s Pride and Grass Run Farms – is doing. The legal complaint notes that “the JBS Group has made sweeping representations to consumers about its commitment to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions, claiming that it will be ‘Net Zero by 2040.’” But those claims aren’t grounded in reality, the complaint goes on to argue, not only because JBS isn’t taking concrete steps toward those goals, but because as recently as September 2023, the CEO admitted in a public forum that the company didn’t even know how to calculate all of its emissions. It follows that what can’t be measured won’t be mitigated.
“Consumers are beginning to be aware of the fact that meat, and particularly beef, has a very, very high climate impact. JBS is fully aware of this, and trying to get ahead of that by telling consumers, ‘Oh, don’t worry, we’ve got it under control,’” said Peter Lehner, managing attorney of the sustainable food and farming program at Earthjustice. “But these emissions are so big and so hard to abate that JBS’s actions don’t show that it’s plausible that they’ll get to their claim.”
The climate crisis is often framed as primarily a problem caused by fossil fuels, and they do play an important role in heating the planet. But even if we could magically reduce fossil fuel emissions to zero tomorrow, according to data scientist and Oxford researcher Hannah Ritchie, our current food systems mean we’d still blow “well past the 1.5 degrees carbon budget, and use up nearly all of our two degrees budget”. What that ought to tell us, she added, “is that we just cannot tackle climate change without also tackling food systems”.
And beef, of which JBS is the largest producer in the world, far outpaces not only plant-based food, but other animal sources of nutrition as well, when it comes to climate impacts. Cows belch methane, and they’re largely fed grains that are grown in fertilizer-intensive monocultures where excess fertilizer causes water pollution or turns into nitrous oxide, another potent greenhouse gas, said Lehner. And that’s not even taking into account the slashing and burning of the Amazon to make room for more cattle, which JBS has been linked to many times over.
Still, for all the environmental stakes, Lehner highlighted that the suit is at its core a consumer fraud case first and foremost. This isn’t the first climate case to take on corporate greenwashing, he said, pointing to prior cases against Volkswagen, which was sued for lying about how “clean” its diesel engines were, and suits against Delta and KLM, which were taken to court for greenwashing the climate impacts of flying. But the JBS case marks “the first one against a beef company”, Lehner said.
It’s also unique because of who filed the suit, according to Delci Winders, director of the Animal Law and Policy Institute at Vermont Law and Graduate School. While most of the other greenwashing cases have been brought by non-profits or even individuals, the JBS suit coming directly from a state attorney general stands out. “To see the government step in like this sends a strong signal,” Winders said.
The pursuit of a case was perhaps spurred on by how flagrantly JBS has gone about making unsubstantiated claims, even ignoring the advice of the advertising arm of the Better Business Bureau, a self-regulating industry body, that warned JBS to be careful about its climate-focused messaging.
The odds of the attorney general winning the case look good. Lehner, who worked at the New York attorney general’s office for eight years, said: “The evidence in this case is at least as strong, if not much stronger, than the evidence and many other consumer fraud cases that have been successful.”
Paglia put it even more forcefully: there’s “no chance, really”, of the attorney general losing, in his estimation.

So what will it mean if the biggest meat company on Earth loses a lawsuit aimed at tamping down greenwashing?
First, it would mean that JBS can no longer claim to be some kind of climate hero. Rather than stating that it’s headed for net zero or climate neutrality, it would probably need to stick to saying “‘we sell meat,’ and that would be the extent”, said Paglia.
Even if JBS were somehow to win the case in New York, it would still emerge from the battle on shakier ground if other US states, or countries elsewhere, decided to take the company to court. “They would be quite vulnerable under other state consumer protection laws,” said Winders.
It’s not hard to imagine future suits down the line, especially since this is not the first action taken against JBS. Earlier this year, US senators wrote a bipartisan letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission asking that the company be blocked from listing on the New York Stock Exchange, essentially alleging that the company engages in investor fraud. And a call for a criminal investigation of banks invested in JBS was filed in France late last year arguing that the banks’ financial support for Brazil’s biggest beef companies was contributing to illegal deforestation in the Amazon.
It’s not clear exactly how long the attorney general’s case will take, and that could be affected by whether JBS’s legal team sees it as more advantageous to be minimally cooperative to slow the case down or whether it tries to settle quickly to get the issue out of the public eye, noted Winders.
But whatever happens, the repercussions will probably affect how more and more businesses operate – or at least what they tell the public – about their climate bona fides in the future.
“If JBS loses – and they’re going to – I think it’s already sending a signal to major companies that you cannot just say ‘We’re Paris [agreement]-aligned.’ You cannot just say ‘We’re going to be net zero in 2030’ when you have no plan, and the curve for your climate pollution is going straight up,” said Paglia. “You cannot keep lying like this.”Polls can’t predict – but they can warn. And I’m not sure our horserace-obsessed media are heeding the warning
I learned the hard way to be skeptical about the predictive power of public opinion polls.
I remember election night 2016 all too well, as I hit delete on my partially pre-written Washington Post column and instead tried to look into the future of a Trump presidency. It was a future that wasn’t supposed to happen.
An entire nation of journalists was doing much the same. Not everyone, but a whole lot of us.
Given that searing memory, I reacted to the recent much-trumpeted Wall Street Journal poll about the 2024 presidential race with, well, not exactly a shrug, but not a primal scream either.
That was the poll that said Donald Trump is leading Joe Biden in six of seven crucial battleground states, the very ones most likely to determine who gets elected in November. The former president is ahead, according to the Journal’s poll, in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina; the two candidates are tied in Wisconsin.
That doesn’t mean anything definitive seven months away from the election. Yet – as someone who thinks another four years of Trump would be a disaster – I believe there’s something to be learned here.
Rather than dismiss these findings, think about what they tell us, even if they do so imperfectly and even if they lack any real predictive power.
One of the things these numbers suggest is that the journalists are not getting the truth across to citizens on some key points (or if they are, that truth is being ignored).
The poll respondents claim that one of their big concerns is the economy. If that’s the case, they should be happy with Biden. Among the factors: low inflation, significant growth and low unemployment. Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate economist, wrote recently: “The economic news in 2023 was almost miraculously good.” (Even the cost of a classic Thanksgiving dinner, he notes, was down 4.5% last year.)
If the economy is that strong and that important to voters – and if Biden can take at least some of the credit – why isn’t it coming across? That’s something for the Biden campaign, primarily; but it’s also something for media people since journalists are supposed to be communicating information so that citizens can vote with knowledge. That should be a higher priority than generating profits, ratings and clicks, but one eventually despairs that it ever will be.
Another major voter concern, of course, is Biden’s age. He’s 81; Trump will be 78 in June. They’re both old; both have memory gaps and both exhibit confusion at times.
Only one of them, however, talks about some migrants as “animals” or predicts a “bloodbath” for the country if he loses. Only one is facing dozens of charges related to crimes including trying to overturn a legitimate election. Only one has promised to be a dictator on day one of his presidency and only one has allies that are meticulously plotting a radical revamping of how America works.
A fine Associated Press story carried the headline, “Trump’s plans if he returns to the White House include deportation raids, tariffs and mass firings.” The story notes that the ideas are extreme and the groundwork determined. “Some of his current ideas would probably end up in court or impeded by Congress,” it said. “But Trump’s campaign and allied groups are assembling policy books with detailed plans.”
Poll respondents also claim to be deeply concerned about the state of democracy in America.
They should be, of course, but what they mean by that differs widely. Do they know as much about Trump’s authoritarian blueprints as they do about how Biden walks these days with a stiffer gait?
I’m not quite as dismissive as the media critic Mark Jacob, who scoffed that there’s “only one poll that matters. It’s seven months from now. The rest is just empty calories filling airtime.”
And I do take seriously the analysis by Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo, who looked at the Journal poll and several others, comparing them with earlier ones, and concluding that Biden is making slow, uneven progress.
That progress, Marshall thinks, may accelerate as more Americans realize that, like it or not, these two candidates are the actual choices. No Nikki Haley or Gretchen Whitmer is waiting in the wings.
Polls can’t predict. But they can warn. And maybe a red-alert warning is what low-information Americans – and our horserace-obsessed media – need most of all.
Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and cultureIsrael’s opening of aid routes is welcome and overdue. But much more is needed
A pivotal point has arrived in the cataclysmic six‑month war in Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces’ killing of seven foreign aid workers and their Palestinian driver has spurred the US, the UK and other European allies to draw the line that they should have established long ago. On Thursday, Joe Biden called for an immediate ceasefire and told Benjamin Netanyahu that future support would depend on Israel taking steps to protect civilians and relief workers.
These warnings come too late for tens of thousands of Palestinians, mostly women and children. But they could now protect others from the continued offensive, the threatened ground assault in Rafah, and the famine setting in: Oxfam says that people in the north are consuming on average just 245 calories a day. Faced with the prospect of sanctions or a halt to arms deals, Mr Netanyahu’s war cabinet agreed to the opening of the Erez crossing and temporary use of the port of Ashdod in southern Israel. But as the US secretary of state, Antony Blinken, has said, “the real test is results”. The US government wants to see them within days.
A massive scaling-up of aid must be matched by a dramatic reduction in casualties. The killing of the World Central Kitchen staff highlighted not only the desperate need in Gaza but also the IDF’s conduct of the war. It has now sacked two senior officers over the “grave mistake”, but these deaths were not an anomaly; they underscored the hollowness of its claims to minimise civilian casualties. That is made even more starkly clear in testimony from intelligence officials over the use of artificial intelligence to identify targets and the “very lenient” rules on how many civilian deaths were permissible.
Mr Biden’s call came amid growing pressure. The US president had looked not only complicit but weak, as the Israeli prime minister ignored pleas and criticism alike. On Friday, the United Nations Human Rights Council adopted a resolution calling for Israel to be held accountable for possible war crimes and crimes against humanity. The public sympathy and support for Israel engendered by the Hamas atrocities of 7 October were immense. Yet more voters in the US now disapprove than approve of its conduct of the war. Most UK voters want to stop arms sales. This is not just a moral issue but a legal one. Hundreds of legal experts, including four former supreme court judges, have warned that Britain is breaching international law by continuing to arm Israel.
Even if the war in Gaza stopped tomorrow, the toll of the dead, wounded, orphaned and traumatised ensures that Palestinians will pay the price throughout their lifetimes and over generations. Mr Biden’s embrace of Mr Netanyahu was supposed to prevent regional escalation, yet there is growing concern about an all-out conflict with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel is on high alert amid fears of Iranian retaliation for the killing of Revolutionary Guards commanders in diplomatic premises in Syria.
The opening of aid corridors following Mr Biden’s call only reinforces the fact that Israel’s allies should have acted decisively earlier. Instead, the US allowed a critical UN security council resolution to pass, then called it non-binding; the president spoke of red lines, then erased them moments later. What is needed now is what was needed months ago: a ceasefire in Gaza, the release of hostages, and a massive, sustained humanitarian relief effort. Nothing short of that will do.

Germany, more than any other country, is struggling to disentangle the horrors of the 7 October Hamas massacre in Israel, the subsequent death of more than 30,000 Palestinians and the demolition of Gaza, and the killing of aid workers, from the scale of the Holocaust more than eight decades earlier.
History has come back to haunt Germany with unpredicted ferocity. The confusion is intense, but it predates 7 October and permeates wider questions about the nature of the country’s contemporary society.
Multiculturalism snuck up on Germany without most people realising. Waves of immigration from the 1970s onwards were initially regarded as a temporary layer of labour, dispensable at a whim. The guest workers, mainly from Turkey, were deliberately not integrated. The idea was they would do the dirty jobs (coal mining, cleaning) and go. Except they didn’t; their families joined them, a new generation emerged. After 2000, citizenship rules were loosened. Then came the great wave of migration in 2015, many of them Muslims from war-torn countries such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq.
Germany has changed, and the discomfort is not hard to find. A decision by the council in Frankfurt, the country’s fifth-largest city, to illuminate a pedestrianised shopping street with half-moons, stars and lanterns with the greeting (in English) of “Happy Ramadan” led to a debate about the cost (€75,000) and the appropriateness in a country that still thinks of itself as Christian – even though it is becoming less so.
There are about five million people who identify as Muslim living in Germany (about 6% of the population), but there are few role models in senior positions throughout Germany. Integration is haphazard at best. One example is Germany’s church tax, which is charged at up to 9% of a person’s income tax depending on the state. The tax – which citizens must opt out of – applies to practising Catholics, Protestants and Jews. German governments have toyed with the idea of extending the tax to those who declare themselves Muslim, but this has not yet happened, with officials claiming they are uncertain which Muslim organisation to designate as the official channel to administer the tax through.
When it comes to Israel, Germany is more determined than ever to show its unwavering commitment and to atone for its past. Angela Merkel made clear the country’s approach in a 2008 speech before the Israeli parliament, declaring that support for Israel was an integral part of the Staatsraison, the essence of the German state. Commemorating the Shoah is ubiquitous but it is highly formalised. In day-to-day life, pro-Jewish sentiment is frequently shown, but can sometimes come across as cringey.  As one Anglo-German Jewish acquaintance put it recently: “I do wish they would stop being so unctuous. It makes me uncomfortable.”
The fraught past few months have shown that this formalised approach to Erinnerungskultur, memory culture, is in need of a reassessment. As Ruth Ur, director of the German section of Israel’s Yad Vashem Holocaust Remembrance Center, puts it: “For many people, the Holocaust means almost nothing. It’s not their history or they don’t relate to it.” She believes that it is time for a reset in remembrance culture.
What should that entail? Not a diminution of Germany’s attempts to come to terms with the past, nor its allegiance to Israel. But, as generations pass, memories recede and demographics change, these inviolable principles need to be tested and debated with greater transparency.
The dialogue between the political class, which has no truck with anyone or institution that criticises Israel, and the cultural community, for which this is seen as an attack on free speech, demonstrates the failure of the present approach.
In the past several months, a number of cultural figures and intellectuals, some of them Jewish, have been dropped from institutions over their criticism of Israel. Berlin’s culture senator, Joe Chialo, was forced to scrap a clause that required all artists in receipt of public funds to abide by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s broad definition of antisemitism, after a backlash by artists. Almost as soon as the definition was adopted in 2016, there has been heated debate about whether it was so broad it censored most criticism of the state of Israel.
Berlin and other German cities continue to experience acts of antisemitism, from the firebombing of a synagogue in October to the defacing of the Kindertransport memorial next to Friedrichstrasse station in January that commemorates 10,000 Jewish children who were sent to safety in England in 1938 and 1939. There is little argument that the perpetrators need to be brought to justice.
But there is less agreement over where to draw the line for other actions that could, in certain circumstances, be construed as antisemitic, such as chants at pro-Palestinian demonstrations that some people find intimidating or believe incite violence against Jews.
Fraught arguments over the boundaries between freedom of expression and offensive language that harms social cohesion extends far beyond the perennially disputed line between criticism of Israel and antisemitism. In Germany, this debate is paralysed by the atrocities of the Third Reich.
When I wrote in early November of Germans’ perpetual difficulty in taking an objective stance towards Israel, I was criticised by some. Four months on, with thousands more Palestinians dead, Gaza all but destroyed, aid workers killed and Israel diplomatically beleaguered, I stand by that view even more staunchly.
With the US president, Joe Biden, at loggerheads with Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, it could be said that Germany’s government is now Israel’s staunchest ally. Germany has more leverage in this conflict than it realises, but as ever in international affairs (as with Ukraine), it remains more comfortable operating behind the scenes.
It needs to operate more openly. Domestically, Germany needs to encourage vigorous but respectful debate about free speech versus antisemitism, rather than try to shut it down. Internationally, it needs to show the courage to differentiate between specific actions of Netanyahu’s hard-right government and principled support for Israel.
The abominations of the past – and the requirement for all sections of German society to engage in learning the lessons from its murderous history – should give its government more, not less, legitimacy to act robustly in the present day.

The launch of a “last chance” crowdsourcing tool to record a vanishing Greek dialect drew attention back this week to one of the great extinctions of the modern world: nine languages are believed to be disappearing every year. Romeyka, which is spoken by an ageing population of a few thousand people in the mountain villages near Turkey’s Black Sea coast, diverged from modern Greek thousands of years ago. It has no written form.
For linguists, it is a “living bridge” to the ancient Hellenic world, the loss of which would clearly be a blow. But some languages are in even bigger trouble, with 350 that have fewer than 50 native speakers and 46 that have just one. A collaboration between Australian and British institutions paints the situation in stark colours, with a language stripes chart, devised to illustrate the accelerating decline in each decade between 1700 and today. Its authors predict that between 50% and 90% of the world’s 7,000 languages will be extinct by 2150. Even now, half of the people on the planet speak just 24 of them.
The United Nations is so concerned that it has declared an International Decade of Indigenous Languages. In this doomsday scenario, the sort of easy-to-use recording technology employed by Crowdsourcing Romeyka is a gamechanger, not least because there may turn out to be pockets of Romeyka speakers around the world.
The history of languages has always been linked to colonialism and political persecution, which scatter populations as well as suppressing them. The paradoxical role of big cities in the survival of even the smallest of them is revealed by the Endangered Languages Alliance (ELA), which has tracked down and mapped hundreds of languages in New York. Among its more startling revelations is that, of 700 surviving speakers of Seke, which originated in a cluster of mountain villages in Nepal, more than 150 can be traced to two apartment buildings in Brooklyn.
It is one thing to record and archive endangered languages but, even among linguists themselves, there is a debate about whether they should be preserved at all costs. On the one side was Ken Hale, an activist who famously argued that losing any language was “like dropping a bomb on the Louvre”. On the other is the Cambridge professor behind the Romeyka project, Ioanna Sitaridou, who believes that it is up to speakers to decide whether to pass on their tongue.
But social and economic priorities change, and it is not unknown for minority languages to skip a generation. One such is Manx, which was downgraded from extinct to critically endangered by Unesco after schoolchildren got in touch, asking: “If our language is extinct then what language are we writing in?” A strategy is now in place to double the number of Manx speakers on the Isle of Man in a decade.
At a time of catastrophic environmental change, there are pragmatic reasons for listening in to the wisdom of linguistic communities that might be vanishingly small on their own, but which together speak more than half of the world’s surviving languages. From Sami reindeer herders across the Arctic to Australia’s Indigenous peoples, the ways in which people express themselves encode ancient ways of living in nature. Both a will and a way are needed if they are to survive. By simply honouring their existence, linguists play an important role.People want good lives for themselves, but the UK has taken so much from the Caribbean. Better to help the islands thrive
Does it matter if we in England are recruiting teachers so heavily in Jamaica that classrooms there don’t have enough of them? Ask those who run school systems in the Caribbean that desperately need their brightest and best. People will always want to be mobile. The issues are in what numbers, and why and how.
When I became director of education in Hackney in 1989, the first Black person to hold such a post, there was a massive shortage of primary school teachers and secondary maths and science teachers across the country. I recruited 55 teachers in Trinidad to come to work in Hackney; 50 in primary schools and five in secondary schools. They had all been made redundant by their government on the order of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as part of a structural adjustment programme. I insisted on three things. One, that they would come to England as family units unless they were single. Two, that Hackney would be responsible for finding them accommodation and school and college places for their children and would help to find employment for their spouses who were not teachers; and three, that they would all be supported to gain qualified teacher status and graduate and postgraduate qualifications.
They were given work permits for two years, at the end of which the Home Office insisted they return to Trinidad. I had a running battle with the Department for Education and the Department for Employment that resulted in all 55 teachers being given permanent leave to remain, though some of them decided to return to Trinidad for family reasons. The rest made a massive contribution to improving schooling outcomes in Hackney, with some of them becoming subject advisers, school heads and deputies.
This was no brain drain. Rather, it was acknowledging that while the IMF was prepared to decimate Trinidad’s workforce of highly competent and experienced teachers, Hackney council was fully aware of the role they could play in school improvement – especially as there were so few Black teachers in Hackney and, indeed, London.
The training and induction the teachers received in Trinidad and on arrival in London gave them a thorough understanding of race and education here, and of the challenges they were likely to face. As Black teachers with excellent teaching skills and a love for the children they taught, they made a difference to the learning experience and educational achievement of each and every pupil, despite the stereotypical expectations parents and their own teaching colleagues may have had of them.
But that doesn’t seem to be what is happening now in terms of detail and strategy. By choosing to recruit Jamaican teachers as “the right kind of immigrants” to help solve England’s teacher shortage, the government and its academies are failing to pay sufficient regard to the experience of teachers generally – homegrown Black teachers in particular – and the political context of schooling and race.
What expectations do employers have of the workload Jamaican teachers would be expected to carry? How do they deal with situations in which new teachers’ experiences translate into management practices and decision-making that may conflict with the culture of an English school? How will they fare in academies that exclude disproportionate numbers of Black students, given the community’s continuing concern about wasteful, discriminatory and destructive school exclusions?
What’s needed is not a poaching exercise, but a change of mindset. In 2015, David Cameron offered the Jamaican government £25m to build a new prison. Jamaica has a growing crime problem and a terrible murder rate, given its population size. Rather than facilitating Jamaica to lock up its “foreign nationals” serving time in British jails and awaiting deportation, the country should acknowledge its historical responsibility for the state of Jamaica’s schools and the lack of opportunity for its school leavers, especially those from poor urban areas, and invest in repair.
Those teachers who have made the journey are doing what many before have done, and are understandably pursuing what they think is best for themselves and their families. England, meanwhile, has every right to operate in its own interests. It has never done otherwise, and will happily denude the former colony of its qualified and experienced teaching force, whom it played no part in schooling and training. But Jamaica’s teachers also have a job to do: nation-building, educating the nation’s youth and equipping future leaders. England should focus on enabling Jamaica to pay its teachers to achieve working conditions and salary levels that will not be push factors for their migration to English schools.
England has taken unthinkable amounts from the Caribbean, and it still does so. It should think more about how it behaves and what it gives back.

The searing question for Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Sir Dave Brailsford can be simply framed: is Erik ten Hag two or three signings from transforming Manchester United or does a new manager need hiring because the Dutchman is culpable for the disjointed play, points dropped deep into added time and the flatlining performance of Marcus Rashford and others?
As Ratcliffe, who executes United’s football policy, and his key lieutenant, Brailsford, assess whether Ten Hag is the manager for them there is a body of evidence to work through that takes in serial injuries, the Mason Greenwood and Jadon Sancho sagas, Antony’s “off-field issues”, the powderpuff structure they inherited and a chronic scattergun recruitment policy.
The view here is that all of the above clouds the picture of Ten Hag’s candidacy.
Clearer is what the Dutchman achieved last term when Greenwood, Sancho, Antony and the injuries were non-issues. Contending, still, with an unfit-for-purpose back-of-house operation Ten Hag broke a six-year trophy drought in claiming the Carabao Cup, reached the FA Cup final and finished third.
This came, too, despite the mess of the previous season bequeathed to Ten Hag which featured Ole Gunnar Solskjær being sacked, the caretaker manager, Ralf Rangnick, declaring the club needed “open heart surgery” and United ending in a dire sixth position, 35 points behind Manchester City.
After sifting through this and weighing their importance as factors, Ratcliffe and Brailsford can turn to a squad that requires reinforcements and decide how the right ones could aid Ten Hag.
Profitability and sustainability rules mean limited funds, so even mirroring the three £40m-plus additions of last summer may not occur. But if this can be replicated then Ten Hag would benefit most from a centre-back, central midfielder and goalscorer. A case can be made, too, for a goalkeeper, full-back and winger. But, being realistic, strengthening a defensive structure that has allowed a Premier League high 224 shots (the most by eight) is a burning priority.
In central defence Lisandro Martínez, Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelöf, Jonny Evans and Raphaël Varane are either injured too frequently or perform inconsistently, or both. Of this quintet only Martínez is good enough in the drive to make United contenders once more but he is out, again, for four weeks or so with a muscle problem. This follows previous layoffs of a month, five months and a month because of foot and knee injuries.
Maguire is a first choice after the club failed to sell him last summer. As quaint, in a different way, is the presence of the 36-year-old Evans. Currently injured, he was signed on a free after a summer trial, which points to the financial belt tightening Ten Hag contends with. Of Varane and Lindelöf, the former is one-paced and physically infirm, and Lindelöf lacks the aggression and conviction to dominate forwards.
On any defensive linchpin target wishlist could be Everton’s Jarrad Branthwaite, Bayern Munich’s Matthijs de Ligt and Lille’s Leny Yoro. Playing fantasy football for a moment, if one of these were signed and fielded alongside an always fit Martínez, with Luke Shaw (again no longer a treatment room fixture) at left-back and Diogo Dalot at right-back, an upgrade is achieved.
Moving into the engine room, where Casemiro is ageing, an ideal partner for Kobbie Mainoo would add flair and guile as well as the defensive nous of, say, Newcastle’s Bruno Guimarães. Sign, also, a proven forward to support Rasmus Højlund – West Ham’s Jarrod Bowen, who has 15 Premier League goals and operates wide or centrally, for example – and United could line up thus: Onana; Dalot, Yoro, Martínez, Shaw; Mainoo, Guimarães; Bowen, Fernandes, Garnacho; Højlund.

Rashford, Casemiro, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Willy Kambwala, Scott McTominay, Amad Diallo and Mason Mount would push this XI from the ranks. And with the new chief executive, Omar Berrada, in place alongside, possibly, the incoming football director Dan Ashworth (dependent on the compensation agreement with Newcastle), Ratcliffe and Brailsford would feel Ten Hag has been given every chance of success.
In this scenario it would be “over to you Erik – show us what you can do”. But the opposite view has Ratcliffe and Brailsford blaming the Dutchman for a major part in or all of the team’s ills. His role in signing the underwhelming Casemiro, Mount, André Onana and Antony. The bitty style. A lack of in-game management and the apparently weak mentality that cost five vital points in the hunt for Champions League football via Thursday’s added-time defeat at Chelsea and Saturday’s added-time draw at Brentford. Rashford’s slump in form and errant off-field conduct. The puzzling recasting of Maguire and McTominay from for-sale players last close season to vital components in this one (the latter is United’s joint-top league scorer).
From this thicket of competing factors, Ratcliffe and Brailsford can be excused for wondering what is the best way forward. They may feel clarity will be offered should the FA Cup not be won (United face Coventry in the semi-finals) or Champions League football not achieved.
Equally, they could decide regardless that Ten Hag, with two years’ experience in English football’s hottest seat, represents their best hand and that it would be better to stick than twist with a new manager who may disappoint.
Ratcliffe’s 27.7% buy-in of United was protracted, partly, because of the time required to thrash out the terms of his demand to control football matters. The 71-year-old has this now, and is experiencing exactly how devilish is the nature of the hydra-headed beast he grapples with.Erik ten Hag believes Manchester United’s added-time capitulation at Chelsea will make them “mad and angry” for Liverpool’s visit on Sunday.
United led 3-2 as Thursday’s game entered the 99th-minute before a Cole Palmer penalty and the same player’s 101st-minute strike gave Chelsea victory. The defeat leaves United 11 points behind fourth-place Aston Villa and nine from Tottenham in fifth.
Liverpool will start the weekend as leaders by two points, with eight matches left. United knocked Jürgen Klopp’s side out of the FA Cup last month and beat them at Old Trafford in the league last season. Ten Hag was asked how a third win could be achieved.
“First I have to deal with this,” he said of events at Chelsea. “But we can’t deal with this for long. We have to recover very quickly.
“We have to turn this around, so from Friday we will be in a positive mood, looking forwards. We have to take energy. We will be mad, angry and you can take a lot of energy from that and that is the way we have to do it.”
The added-time loss at Chelsea followed the 1-1 draw at Brentford last Saturday that came after United conceded Kristoffer Ajer’s equaliser in the 99th minute. “In stoppage time this week we have dropped five points – it’s very expensive,” Ten Hag said. “The points are getting more expensive because the games are running out and we know that. We have to catch up and we are now many points behind, so it will be difficult.”
The manager took heart from United recovering from 2-0 down at Chelsea to lead until the dramatic twist. “We will keep fighting and I’m sure you see: our team, they have character. We have seen an example today as well. They are resilient and I’m sure they will be there on Sunday, to be in the fight against Liverpool.
“We have qualities. We have great players. We can play very high standards. You see against Liverpool and [Chelsea]. We can compete with, beat, the best teams in the Premier League.

When you do it in the Premier League, you can do it across Europe. But we need to learn now how to win games. We have to step up. We have to make better decisions, individually and as a team.”
Ten Hag dropped Marcus Rashford from the lineup at Chelsea, bringing him on after 66 minutes, but the forward failed to make an impact from the bench. “Lately his form is progressing,” Ten Hag said. “He has a big motivation because he wants to be successful with us … He wants to fight for a Champions League spot and the Euros are coming. So his motivation should be high. Before Brentford he scored three goals in three games.”Jürgen Klopp and Erik ten Hag have appealed for fans at Old Trafford on Sunday to avoid the tragedy chanting that marred Manchester United’s recent FA Cup win over Liverpool.
Klopp called on supporters to “show a bit of class” and his United counterpart said the game must not be “used as an excuse for abusing rival fans” about past tragedies.
Two United supporters were arrested on suspicion of tragedy chanting after their team’s thrilling 4-3 victory last month. The Football Association issued a statement condemning the chants that emanated from the Stretford End before and during the game.
With the fierce rivals meeting again in the Premier League, Klopp has made another attempt to address tragedy-related abuse in the fixture. The Liverpool manager and his United counterpart, Ten Hag, issued a joint statement last season calling for an end to chanting about Hillsborough, Heysel and Munich. The two clubs’ charity foundations have also come together to deliver an education programme to schoolchildren on the impact of tragedy-related abuse.
“I think it is super important,” said Klopp as he prepared for the return to Old Trafford. “There are different aspects but one aspect is that I don’t hear it, honestly, when I am on the sideline but I get told it happens and that is obviously not great. But in general it is just helpful that we educate our kids in specific things: respect, understanding, all these kinds of things.
“I just see two of the biggest clubs in the world, so let’s just show a bit of class in these moments. Don’t sing this or sing that. Just show class, let the teams fight on the pitch, let’s play football; that is all fine. Besides that, just show a bit of class, that would be my wish for all of us.”
Ten Hag said in words released early from his programme notes: “It is part of my duty to remind every supporter fortunate enough to be at the game that it must be enjoyed in the proper way, and not used as an excuse for abusing rival fans about Hillsborough, Heysel or any other historic tragedies.
“This is one of the truly great rivalries in world sport, for so many of the right reasons, and it is our responsibility to keep it that way. Whether the clubs meet at Old Trafford or Anfield, all supporters must focus entirely on backing their team and both Jürgen and I trust that we can count on that happening today.”
Meanwhile, Klopp has explained why he snapped at a reporter who questioned Liverpool’s lack of intensity during their FA Cup defeat at United and insisted there will be no repeat – at least from his team – when they meet on Sunday.
Footage of the Liverpool manager walking out of a post-match interview with Viaplay’s Niels Christian Frederiksen went viral following the quarter-final. Klopp took exception to Frederiksen asking why Liverpool’s intensity dropped during extra time and angrily cut the interview short. He believes the impact of the two clubs’ contrasting schedules became clear in extra time and was a major factor in the defeat. The FA Cup tie was Liverpool’s ninth game in 30 days and they had played in the Europa League three days earlier. United, who had a free week to prepare for the home fixture, were playing their sixth match in 29 days.
“There was this famous interview afterwards – I’d like to say I was out of the country [for the fall-out] but I wasn’t, I stayed in the country – but I knew what would happen,” Klopp said. “I was really calm after the game, I was not angry, because I knew that, yes, we had to win it in this [90 minute] period. The first 15-20 minutes United were there, really aggressive and scored the goal. But then we took over and it was the best we played against them for a while for sure. In similar situations there was really good football without scoring. After 90 minutes, I saw minute by minute that it was too much. It was the end of this intense spell, and now extra time was the killer for us.

“That’s why I said after the game that it was the first time I saw us struggling. It was too much for this specific group, with the way we had to change, with the players coming back just in time for this game and these kind of things. But I was not angry. And then the guy asked me about intensity and that was just when it snapped. As if anybody would be interested in the intensity or why you cannot keep up the intensity with them? United played I don’t know how many less games than we had until then. But the game was brilliant in moments, absolutely brilliant, but we did not have the legs that day obviously to use it.
“You saw these quick attacks we had, these four v three situations, and then unlikely for us we pretty consistently found the wrong player to finish it off. There is nothing you can do. That is just when the brain is not really fresh and the boys don’t see the right solution. That’s how it is and you have to accept it and I did. We lost because they stayed in the game, scored their goals, we made mistakes for two of them, and that’s how it happened.”
Klopp believes intensity will not be an issue for his players on Sunday, when his Premier League leaders could take a significant step towards the title by avenging their FA Cup loss.
The Liverpool manager added: “We play Manchester United, an opponent who is probably not 100% happy with how their season has gone. So what can they do with this specific [FA Cup] game? You saw after the game we played against them how they felt after it and what it meant to them. But for us it’s just as important and I cannot see us playing football any differently. Intensity is a good thing, it is needed. It is focus, it’s concentration, it’s involvement, it’s will. We want to go for it. To go to Old Trafford and winning is already a big task but in our position there aren’t a lot of alternatives to that. We have eight games to go and we need to be focused. And we will be.”Manchester City kick off the weekend at Crystal Palace while leaders Liverpool travel to Manchester United on Sunday

Form LLLDDW Leading scorer Wood 11The driver, one of F1’s most striking talents, on being an overthinker, his belief in McLaren and how he strives to improve
Lando Norris does not even try to suppress a playful laugh of self-recognition as he considers the proposition that, unlikely as it may seem, one of Formula One’s most striking talents shares a common trait with Springfield’s beer-drinking, couch jockey and all-round pop-culture hero, Homer Simpson.
“I am a big overthinker, I do think a lot about different scenarios good and bad, and I am absolutely critical of myself,” Norris says. So when it’s put to him that this sounds like the comical internal arguments Homer has with his own brain, the 24-year-old hoots in acknowledgment.
“Yes, I talk with my brain a lot,” he replies with a broad smile. “I am always in my head. It’s not that I don’t know how to focus, I am very good at thinking about many different things, at being able to focus on what I need to focus on. It’s more that I think a lot about certain things and I am not happy until I have an answer to whatever that issue or problem is.”
The driver, in his sixth season in F1, all of which have been with McLaren, rightly views this as a strength but is also conscious that it could be perceived differently when his thoughts are thundering about, clamouring for attention.
“I am self-critical and I know it can look bad from the outside, absolutely,” he says. “I watch my own interviews and I look so annoyed and unhappy. It’s because my mind is whirling, I’m thinking: ‘Why did I make a mistake? What happened if I did this or that? What if I had tried something else?’
“But I set high goals for myself, I know what I am capable of, I want to try to achieve great things and I am not going to do that by being complacent.”
Norris is far from the tousled-haired youth who made his F1 debut in 2019. He is physically bigger, the jawline is stronger and he is more confident, more at ease as befits a young man who has handled growing up in public with no little assurance and will compete in his 108th race in Japan this weekend.
His open embrace of the emotions racing inspires is one of the most endearing aspects of his character and has made him one of the most popular of the new generation of drivers. The emotions have ranged from his sheer despair after a win slipped away in the wet when he stayed out on slicks in the rain at Sochi in 2021, to his fury at blowing a potential pole in Qatar last year that could have put him in position for another shot at that maiden win.
The McLaren team principal, Andrea Stella, noted that Norris’s embrace of this is why he is becoming a more complete driver and why he has such huge faith in him. “It’s 360 degrees,” Stella said. “He goes from the self-reflection of the driver understanding when you don’t deliver, [then to] why?” It is, Stella has insisted, “world champion material, the underlying talent, the mindset, the work ethic. It’s all there”.
Norris, for all the pursuit of improvement, remains fond of joking and of a verbal spar, still trying to enjoy as much as he can the elements of the job most drivers only endure. He does not dash off answers but gives them consideration, not least when he feels he has been misinterpreted.
Last year, after signing a new deal with McLaren, he was criticised for saying he would not want to be Max Verstappen’s teammate, prompting accusations he was afraid of the Dutchman which he is more than happy to put to bed.
“I believe I can achieve a championship at McLaren, that’s why I signed another contract,” he says. “I absolutely think I can go up against Max and give him a good challenge. But I also rate Max, so for anyone it’s extremely difficult to go up against Max in his team and challenge him for a world championship. He could have moved to Mercedes back in the day and gone up against Lewis [Hamilton] but would it have been a smart idea to have done that? Probably not and he probably wouldn’t be in a Red Bull now and it would be a different story.

“I am not afraid in any way of Max, I’m excited to be against Max. People rate him as up with the best, so I would like to prove myself by going up against that. I look forward to being able to battle him, but genuinely for position and not have him half a second a lap quicker and just drive past me.”
There is an honesty here then, a characteristic that is highly rated not only at the top at McLaren but by the personnel putting his car together.
As reserve driver with McLaren, Norris would stay behind to help the crew pack up after a race and he still tries to forge proper relationships with them. The No 2 mechanic on his car, Frazer Burchell, cites times when the driver has arranged tickets for festivals or shows and the personal connection he makes which has engendered a camaraderie and affection for him. “He only has to be polite to us but Lando always goes much further than that,” Burchell, who wields the front jack when Norris pits, said.
Last year Japan proved to be one of the resurgent McLaren’s best tracks, with Norris and his teammate, Oscar Piastri, returning second and third place, and they will be optimistic at Suzuka this weekend. Norris has no doubts that elusive first win will come, one debate at least not given airtime in the internal dialogue.
“I feel on top of everything I can be in control of,” he says. “I’ve made a conscious effort of trying to find more improvement. To work on my weaknesses, of getting in the gym a little bit more, making better decisions. Little things along the way which add up over a whole season. I feel in the best place I have ever felt.”Toto Wolff has said the parlous ­fortunes of Mercedes compelled him to join his team on the ground for this weekend’s Japanese Grand Prix, having originally planned not to be in attendance at Suzuka.
Heading into this fourth round, the optimism with which ­Mercedes had entered the season had long since evaporated and instead Wolff ­conceded in the buildup to the ­Japanese GP that he had to lead from the front on the ground, and opted to fly out and join the team.
Wolff, who led Mercedes through their eight consecutive constructors’ championships between 2014 and 2021, believed the team’s attempt to make a step forward with the car required him to be at the helm.
“I had planned not to come to Japan because there’s so much on back in Europe, things to do, but then I felt not coming to Japan was the wrong choice,” he said.
“I think it’s important to be with the race team also. It does me good also to be close to the action. We are experimenting with a few things and then being part of the team really gives me energy. I hope the other way around too. So that’s why I decided against staying in Europe.”
Mercedes have now struggled with their car for the third season in a row, having been comprehensively ­outpaced by Red Bull and in the opening races by Ferrari, then in Australia by McLaren. The car is unstable and unpredictable in differing conditions, with the team admitting that once more there was a lack of correlation between predicted performance in the wind tunnel and the reality on track.
In Japan Lewis Hamilton lambasted it as inconsistent, making it remarkably hard to drive with confidence. “It’s just different every single corner, there’s no way you can know to get it right,” he said. “Even if it was consistently different between low, medium and high, you could then get your mind around it, but it’s not. It’s just different in every single corner and at different yaw and different speeds. So it’s a challenge.”
The team are hopeful that research on ironing out some of the ­inconsistencies in performance will be made here in Suzuka, ­particularly ­relating to how the effects of changes in temperatures and wind can be ­minimised. That was at least in evidence after Friday’s practice which Hamilton described as “a great session – the best session that we’ve had this year. It was the best the car has felt this year so far, so it felt really positive and I was really excited.” His Mercedes teammate, George Russell, was also in buoyant mood: “We definitely performed better than we expected, so that was a pleasant surprise. Lewis and I were really happy with the balance.”
Wolff also praised Sebastian Vettel after the four-time champion, who retired in 2022, was connected with a possible return to F1 with Mercedes, with Hamilton stating he would love to see Vettel replace him when he moves to Ferrari.

“Sebastian is someone that you can never discount,” he said. “I think his track record is phenomenal. And sometimes maybe taking a break is also good to re-evaluate what’s important for you and refine your motivation.”
Red Bull, however, look to be once more firmly in control after they ­suffered a setback when Max ­Verstappen, the world champion, failed to finish after a brake failure at the last round in Melbourne. The high-speed corners of Suzuka are exceptionally well-suited to their car, which enjoys superb balance, a vital advantage especially through the tricky first sector of the opening two corners, the Esses and the Dunlop curve.
They have also brought their first major upgrades of the season to Japan, with new cooling inlets and updates to the floor and brakes. ­Verstappen, who loves driving the ­circuit and has been the ­winner here for the last two years, was ­immediately up to speed, ­heading first ­practice on Friday, before the ­second session offered limited ­running because of rain.The start of England’s defence of their European title got off to a frustrating start in front of 63,248 at Wembley, with Sarina Wiegman’s side held to a 1-1 draw by a resilient Sweden.
Drawn in the Euro 2025 qualifying ‘Group of Death’ with the World Cup bronze medallists, Euro 2022 semi-finalists France and the only team from pot four to have qualified for the 2023 World Cup, the Republic of Ireland, England needed a strong start to the campaign to retain their European title.
However, despite Alessia Russo’s diving header to open proceedings and haunt the Swedes, who were on the receiving end when the forward scored a sublime backheel in their 4-0 Euro semi-final defeat of Sweden in 2022, Fridolina Rolfö’s headed effort was enough to ensure the spoils were shared.
“In the Nations League you have very competitive games and Sweden is a very tough opponent,” Wiegman said. “I do think we could have done a couple of things better … but it just shows how close and how tight our competition is.”
Wiegman made one change to the team that earned an impressive 5-1 win over Italy in a friendly in February in Marbella. Lauren James returned to the starting XI in place of Chloe Kelly, who had been dropped to the bench in favour of the Australian Mary Fowler at Manchester City in recent weeks.
Significantly, the 21-year-old Tottenham midfielder Grace Clinton, on loan from Manchester United, retained her place in midfield, partnering Keira Walsh, who was targeted by Sweden, and Georgia Stanway.
Leah Williamson, back for England for the first time since she ruptured her anterior cruciate ligament in her knee last April, was on the bench, with her Arsenal teammate Lotte Wubben-Moy, rewarded for her fine domestic form, playing alongside Alex Greenwood in defence.
Meanwhile, Peter Gerhardsson made eight changes to the team that defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina 5-0 to ensure a 10-0 aggregate win that meant Sweden remained in League A for Euro 2025 qualifying.
Wiegman said the Marbella camp had helped the Lionesses reset after December’s disappointing exit from the Nations League, which also ended Team GB’s hopes of Olympic qualification. Sweden at Wembley was the opportunity “for us to again show what we can do and how good we can play” after a somewhat disappointing post-World Cup dip.
There was an early warning sign of the threat posed by Arsenal forward Stina Blackstenius when she was played through a minute in, but Wubben-Moy blocked her effort and Mary Earps was there to collect.
Blackstenius’s club colleague Russo would feel the force of a Magdalena Eriksson challenge minutes later, needing lengthy treatment to bandage a nasty-looking gash on her shin.
Lauren Hemp looked ineffective on the right, having been asked to begin on the unfamiliar flank to allow Lauren James to slot in on the left where she is preferred for Chelsea, but just past 20 minutes there was a switch.
The impact was instant, James clipping a ball in from the right that Russo met with a diving header to power the home team ahead.
Wiegman had wanted a statement performance, but this was far from it. Her charges dominated possession but against the well-organised Swedes they struggled to carve out chances.

Meanwhile, the visiting team were increasingly threatening on the break and they found the equaliser in the 64th minute. A quick throw-in was worked to substitute Rosa Kafaji in the box and she flicked it towards Rolfö at the back post who nodded past Earps.
There was almost instant disaster for England moments later when Blackstenius was played through the middle but Earps came out and the Swedish forward inexplicably put her effort wide.
Ella Toone came on as a substitute for Clinton prior to the equaliser and James exited for Beth Mead just after. There would be further changes for England with just over 10 minutes remaining; Jess Carter and Chloe Kelly replacing Niamh Charles and Russo as they went in search of a late winner.
It was the departure of James that felt most worrying, her creativity the difference when England scored the opener in the first half.
“We wanted more energy in the team, we know she [James] can always change a game, but we wanted more tempo in the game and I thought we got that. Those are technical decisions we make,” said Wiegman.
Hemp went close with two minutes remaining, testing Jennifer Falk before Eriksson cleared her rebounded effort off the line, while Mead forced a save from Falk.
“We want to have the ball a lot, how they press we struggled a bit, we went too much inside and short options we chose,” said Wiegman. “We could have done better with our decision-making on the ball but we found it hard. They defended really well.”Keira Walsh and Georgia Stanway have off nights for European Championship holders in draw against Sweden at Wembley
Sarina Wiegman’s side were given plenty to think about by Sweden who, despite lacking in possession of the ball and having only one shot on target – Fridolina Rolfö’s 64th-minute equaliser – stretched the reigning European champions’ defence throughout. It is a display that will have caused slight consternation in the England camp about how easily Sweden were able to break through as their Euro 2025 qualification campaign got off to a stuttering start.
Wiegman and her assistant Arjan Veurink will have lots to ponder over the next few days fully in the knowledge that the Lionesses must improve defensively. They have been arguably drawn in the toughest qualification group and cannot afford to drop off or lose momentum in games like they did on this occasion if they are to progress directly to next summer’s tournament.
Where they were lacking in particular under the Wembley lights was pace at the back and this was made clear by the speed of Sweden’s attack. Wingers Rolfö and Johanna Rytting Kaneryd were given acres of space to run into while the direct running of Stina Blackstenius stretched England. They could have been made to pay by the latter later in the game, but the forward spurned the opportunity to send the visitors home with three points when one-on-one with Mary Earps.
It will have been a cause for concern for the fans watching on and will increase the calls for Leah Williamson to return. The England captain is back in the Lionesses camp for the first time since tearing her anterior cruciate ligament and was named on the bench for the first time in 362 days. Her leadership and composure in those moments of stress were a hallmark of their success at Euro 2022, something that England have lacked at times in her absence.
It will be hard for Wiegman, however, to decide how to dismantle her backline. The unusual thing about this performance was that neither of the centre-back pairing of Lotte Wubben-Moy and Alex Greenwood had a poor game. In reality, they dealt with Sweden’s front line quite adeptly – strong in their duels; reading the danger; and able to release pressure forward. Greenwood’s passing ability was a crucial aspect in England being able to push up the field.
Where England lacked the most was in midfield, with uncharacteristically careless performances from Keira Walsh and Georgia Stanway. There was little midfield structure when out of possession from the two of them, allowing England to get stretched on the counter. Filippa Angeldal broke the lines through the middle throughout while they were bypassed as the wingers were not afraid to invert and operate more centrally on occasion. It allowed Sweden to bypass the defensive cover and left the centre-back pairing particularly exposed. This, coupled with a carelessness in possession, meant the visitors were able to turn over the ball as the Lionesses pushed up the pitch.
The goal they conceded will have caused particular frustration. With Greenwood occupied by Blackstenius, substitute Rosa Kafaji was allowed space to cross to the far post. Lucy Bronze was found in no man’s land with Rolfö lurking, allowing her a free header.
The bright spark of England’s night, however, was the performance of Alessia Russo. The 25-year-old initially struggled to emerge out of the shadow of Ellen White. With every game, however, Russo is looking more and more comfortable shouldering the responsibility of leading the line.
Russo has fond memories of scoring against Sweden – “the Russo”, her famous backheeled goal came against Peter Gerhardsson’s side in the Euro 2022 semi-finals at Bramall Lane. It was a goal that propelled her into the spotlight that night and she has found the England shirt productive. She amassed three goals at last summer’s World Cup when working in tandem with Lauren Hemp as a front two.

On this occasion, she spearheaded a front three but looked equally as comfortable in her environment. An early gash to the shin did little to dent her energy and she scored England’s only goal with a clinical header off a pinpoint cross from Lauren James. It was her third goal in three games for her country this year and she is evidently Wiegman’s preferred choice, with Rachel Daly left as a substitute.
What sets the Arsenal forward apart from the other options is not only her ability to finish in multiple fashions but the efficiency of her hold-up play. Her ability on the ball allows England to have a focal point, one they know has the technical ability to drop deep, retain possession and feed off to the other members in attack with accuracy.
It will be through her creativity that England will look to build in the coming qualifiers. The Republic of Ireland are next in a historic match at the Aviva Stadium on Tuesday and Wiegman will know improvement will be key to break down an opposition that have proved they are not to be taken for granted.Is there a more raucous crowd in England than that of the Stoop? Is there a crowd more put through the mill? If only Quins were as trustworthy as their faithful, but life is never boring there.
After the craziness of the last couple of weeks, a winning try with five minutes to go might sound a little ho-hum, but having opened up a healthy lead, Marcus Smith pulling the strings wickedly, Quins did their usual of making the crowd sweat.
Glasgow turned the contest on its head by taking the lead for most of the last quarter. Only in those last minutes did Quins finally make one of their penalties to the corner yield a try from a good old-fashioned lineout and drive. And so they proceed to the quarter-finals.
“Fans complain they are always on the edge of their seats,” said Smith. “Whenever we are ahead we let the other team in. And that is something we are trying to work on, the consistency. We are nowhere near where we want to be, but we are in another knockout game in Europe.”
The home side turned round 21-7 up, which sounds a more convincing lead than it was. All the usual Quins traits were there – a certain lack of concentration, a relishing of chaos, a steadfast refusal to take any easy points.
The madness of the win over Bath the week before, which itself came hot on the heels of the capitulation against Saracens the week before that, had the rugby world scratching its head even more than usual over the darlings of west London. And this time they were entertaining a Glasgow side packed with Scotland internationals, riding high in the United Rugby Championship.
Sure enough, the Warriors announced their threat in only the third minute, Scott Cummings burrowing over from close range after a move of 15 phases. Quins at that point looked out of joint. No Bath pyrotechnics here.
But they did have the referee. Whether a lopsided penalty count is just reward for sustained pressure or a scandalous misapplication of the laws depends mostly on the colour of your shirt, but let the record state, Quins were awarded 12 penalties in that first half to Glasgow’s two.
Their lineout-and-drive routines were less than effective at that point, failing to make anything of three penalties sent to the corner in the first quarter. When they finally scored their first try, at the start of the second, it was after another drive had broken down. So they resorted to the chaos they love. Smith’s feet were mesmeric first, then deadly precise a phase later, when he sent a kick to the corner, which André Esterhuizen touched down.
Sione Tuipulotu was shown a yellow card 10 minutes later at the concession of Glasgow’s 10th penalty of the half.
Smith danced through the compromised midfield for Quins’ second, straight from a scrum, before putting Cadan Murley away for their third on the stroke of half-time.

Last week, a 40-3 home lead was made to look less than convincing, so 21-7 did not stand a chance. As if in a script, Glasgow attacked the start of the second half as vigorously as they had the first.
This time, they scored two tries in as many minutes to level the match. A simple lineout-and-drive accounted for Johnny Matthews’ try, before the visitors tried their hand at something more sweeping, Kyle Steyn sending George Horne to the line for the equaliser.
Now it was Glasgow who enjoyed the referee’s endorsement. After a fifth consecutive penalty against Quins, Horne – glory be – chose to take the simple points. And so the Warriors had the lead again on the hour.
Matters deteriorated further for Quins when Joe Marler was shown yellow for catching a Glasgow ball-carrier in the head at the start of the third quarter. The consecutive-penalty count ballooned to nine, as Glasgow turned the screw. Just like their hosts, though, they went for the corner again and again, as if they had forgotten what easy kicks at goal can achieve. Quins held firm, finally winning their first penalty of the second half.
From that they had the foothold they needed. At the second time of asking, the umpteenth of the match, a penalty to the corner led to a convincing drive, Sam Riley claiming the try. One last defensive set was required for one last roar of the home crowd. The latter had endured enough.Owen Farrell has suffered a setback in his quest to ensure his Saracens career ends on a high after he was ruled out of Saturday’s Champions Cup tie against Bordeaux with a hamstring injury.
Farrell picked up the injury in last week’s defeat by Northampton, meaning the former England captain may have played his final match in the competition for Saracens before heading to Racing 92 next season.
Farrell has won the Champions Cup three times with Saracens but is set to be out for “the next few weeks”, so he would also miss the quarter-finals next week should Mark McCall’s side triumph in France. The regular Premiership season finishes in six weeks’ time with Saracens currently third and vying for a playoff spot.
In his absence, Jamie George will deputise as captain for a side aiming to avenge their 55-15 defeat by Bordeaux in the pool stages. Alex Goode comes into the side at fly-half while McCall welcomes Maro Itoje back for a first appearance for the club since the Six Nations with the second row now recovered from a knee injury.
In another pool stage rematch, Leicester travel to Dublin to face Leinster with Freddie Steward, who lost his England place at fullback during the Six Nations, named on the wing. Dan Cole also returns to the side as one of three changes to the side who edged past Newcastle last time out. The Leicester head coach, Dan McKellar, said: “We’re excited to get over to Dublin and rip into this challenge. Their record speaks for itself but, like any game of rugby, if you can apply pressure and deny opportunity consistently, you’ll give yourself a great chance to be in the contest.
“We’ve got a lot of experience and fight in this group so outside of these walls is irrelevant to us; we’ll turn up to the Aviva on Saturday night ready to go with a bucket load of belief.”
In the all Premiership last-16 tie, Exeter host Bath, who recall Charlie Ewels, Sam Underhill, Alfie Barbeary and Joe Cokanasiga to their starting lineup. The Chiefs lost to Sale last time out and Rob Baxter is hoping for a response.
“They’ve got a very strong team across the board,” he said. “They’ve got a lot of resilience amongst the group, so it’s going to be a significant challenge for us this weekend but, at the same time, it’ll be nice to have them at our place.

“We certainly had a kick in the pants from the result against Sale last weekend, so there’s not too much for us to take out of that apart from that it highlighted that you’ve got to be the team that turns up. I would think this weekend’s game will still have all the main ingredients of a Premiership match since it’s two league sides going up against one another. We’ve got to perform better than last week but we’ve also got to be excited that it’s a knockout game here at Sandy Park in front of a sellout crowd. So, we’ve got to hope that that brings a level of performance out of us that we can be proud of.”
On SundayNorthampton welcome Munster to Franklin’s Gardens having pulled off a fine victory at Thomond Park in January. Lewis Ludlam comes into the side and captains Northampton while Alex Mitchell is primed to return from injury having been named among the replacements.The Sporting head coach, Rúben Amorim, has admitted his future may lie elsewhere as Liverpool continue their search for Jürgen Klopp’s successor.
Liverpool have identified the 39-year-old as one of their candidates to take over at Anfield and could bring in the Portuguese for around £12m, if compensation can be agreed with Sporting.
Amorim has become one of Europe’s most sought-after coaches and has been linked with Chelsea and Barcelona after he ended a 19-year-wait for the title in his first full season with Sporting, who are again leading the way this season.
Amorim, who speaks English, was again asked about his future on Friday but did little to calm the speculation. “I cannot make any guarantees [that I will stay at Sporting next season],” Amorim said.
“Sporting are dealing with their future and I can’t decide now because I gave my word, I can’t go back on that, so if I don’t win trophies, I’m going to leave Sporting.
“That’s been very clear since the start. I felt it was important to get that across to the players because we have to win. We want to win trophies and we’ll decide on those things later.
“I’m not worried about that right now. The future has been planned for quite a long time. We’re all together as a club and looking into all situations and what we want for next season, so that’s the main reason why I can’t guarantee anything.
“I said that to my players and as the leader I can’t go back on my word, as hard as that may be. We have to win trophies, we’re on track to do that and that’s why it’s so important to win our next game.”
Liverpool had hoped to tempt Xabi Alonso back to Anfield but the Spaniard has pledged his immediate future to Bayer Leverkusen. They have also cooled their interest in the Brighton head coach, Roberto De Zerbi, as Liverpool’s sporting director Richard Hughes attempts the onerous task of replacing Klopp.Following the success of the World Gay Boxing Championships organisers are addressing behaviours in other combat sports
Last year a two-day amateur boxing competition was held in Sydney, attracting participants and spectators from all over the country and the world. The setting, WorldPride; the event, the first World Gay Boxing Championships.
The competition brought together members of the LGBTQ+ community with allies and the country’s best judges – thanks to support from Boxing Australia and Boxing NSW – as well as boxing champions Gairy St Clair and Kate McLaren. It was the brainchild of Martin Stark, and the culmination of years of work to combat homophobia in the sport and create an international LGBTQ+ boxing competition, after the sport was cut from the Gay Games.
Now Stark is going global – he’s taking the WGBC to the US in June – and he wants to work with other combat sports to increase their efforts in tackling homophobia. Thanks to the abundance of LGBTQ+ leagues and clubs in the US, the support for hosting the WGBC in Chicago has been huge, but you don’t have to look far to see how homophobia remains in the industry.
Recent outbursts from UFC fighter Sean Strickland, and a lack of public condemnation from others within mixed martial arts, indicate there is still a long way to go, Stark says.
“When there’s nobody saying this is unacceptable, you’re signalling that gay men are in some ways subhuman,” he says. “And that language of hate isn’t being challenged enough … What’s the message to the community? Is homophobia now an acceptable behaviour? What’s next?”
Stark says the more he sees homophobia in combat sports, particularly in high-profile and influential competitions like the UFC, the more he wants to “step in and speak up” because he knows it doesn’t align with the values of the vast majority of fans and participants.
“The upside of taking action against homophobia is growing the sport,” he says. “Getting more women involved in UFC, in mixed martial arts, growing the fan base with millennials and Gen Z … getting more young people into gyms where all of those gym owners can grow their business with a part of the market which may have felt excluded.
“I think in the long term, [homophobia] will damage the sport and it will damage the brand. That’s a long-term risk.”
Driving Stark to switch his life’s focus to advocacy and the WGBC is the knowledge that homophobia, and even just a lack of visible support for inclusion, actively deters people from participating in combat sports and means they miss out on the mental and physical benefits they offer.
“[Sport] also offers an important social connection whether you are a participant or fan,” he says. “Sport does that in such a universal way, and that’s why it’s important that we still have events like the World Gay Boxing Championships.
“I want to get to the stage where there is more visible representation of LGBTQ+ people in boxing and other combat sports,” he says. “So people no longer feel they have to come out, they can just be themselves and be supported wherever they are in the world.”
One fighter who took to the ring at the first WGBC at Sydney WorldPride was Sze Sze Rowlinson, a professional Muay Thai fighter who turned to boxing after an ankle injury sustained in a motorcycle accident forced a break from her main sport. The fight was her first since the accident a year earlier, and looking back, she realises it was significant for another reason too – it was the first time she had allowed her identities as a fighter and a queer person to become one.
“It felt like it was meant to happen in some weird way,” she says. “I never actually outwardly promoted that I was some sort of queer fighter [before the WGBC]. I was always trying to just say, ‘I’m a fighter’. Moving through the [martial arts] space, my identity, my sexual orientation or whatever, never really came up.”
But in the midst of her recovery from injury, that began to change. Missing being able to connect with people in the gym, Rowlinson started to reflect on the benefits Muay Thai and martial arts had brought her over the years – the confidence, the lessons, the friends – and realised that, unlike in a lot of team sports, there aren’t the same support networks to help you get through when all of that is stripped away.

So she created the Queer Combat Collective (QCC) – a group that could not only provide support for people already involved in martial arts, but that could also encourage members of the LGBTQ+ community to give it go, when they may have previously felt it wasn’t a safe space for them. As well as putting on some “come and try” events, Rowlinson wants to help gyms become more welcoming.
“A lot of the gyms that I’ve been to are quite friendly,” she says. “But they are very busy, they can be very loud, and a lot of them are catered towards people who might want to spar or compete and what I’m trying to do is get people in the stage before that.
“I’m trying to create a space that people are comfortable in giving some sort of health and wellbeing activity ago … using it as a physical practice rather than coming with all of these connotations of having to be hyper-aggressive or having to fight at the end.”
When Rowlinson launched QCC she didn’t want to be the face of it, but realised she couldn’t do it anonymously if she wanted people to engage with the group.
“I needed to step out of my own shell …” she says. “[I had] to come to terms with taking that step and being like, ‘OK, this is also me, I’ll promote this as part of my identity – I’m a fighter, but I also run this Queer Combat Collective thing.’ It’s something that’s new for me.”
And her invitation from Stark to be part of the WGBC was “perfect timing” for that shift. “That was a really interesting turning point for me personally because it felt like that was the first time my identities merged.”
So as Stark builds inclusivity at the professional end of the scale, Rowlinson sees her work in grassroots martial arts as a crucial link in the chain – getting more people through the door in the first place.
“Not everyone wants to be a fighter, but unless you participate and get a little taste for it, how would you know that that’s something that you’d want to pursue,” she says. “You can’t be what you can’t see and it’s a bit of a cycle that like.”Bronny James will enter the NBA draft after one season at Southern California that was shortened by his recovery from cardiac arrest.
The 19-year-old son of LeBron James announced Friday on his Instagram account that he also plans to retain his college eligibility and will enter the transfer portal.
“I’ve had a year with some ups and downs but all added to growth for me as a man, student and athlete,” James wrote.
James posted his decision hours before USC was set to introduce Eric Musselman as its new coach. He replaces Andy Enfield, who left on Monday to become coach at SMU.

“Bronny is his own man,” the elder James said this week. “He has some tough decisions to make. When he’s ready to make those decisions, he’ll let us all know. But as his family, we’re going to support whatever he does.”
James averaged 4.8 points and 2.8 rebounds while starting six of 25 games for the Trojans. He shot 37% from the field, 27% from three-point range and 68% from the free throw line.
The elder James, his wife and their 9-year-old daughter were frequent courtside spectators at the Galen Center this season.
The 39-year-old James has been vocal about wanting to play with his son in the NBA.
Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul, who represents father and son, said recently that he doesn’t “value a young player getting into the lottery as much as I do getting him on the right team in the right developmental situation”.
James, a 6ft 4in combo guard, didn’t make his college debut until 10 December. Afterward, James appeared in front of the media for less than a minute to thank the doctors, athletic trainers and support system that helped him return to play.
Despite numerous requests, James never spoke to reporters during the season.
He suffered cardiac arrest on 20 July during a workout at the Galen Center. He was found to have a congenital heart defect that was treatable.Mathieu van der Poel, who aims to retain his Paris-Roubaix title ­on Sunday, says riders are the main danger when it comes to race safety.
Thursday’s stage four in the Tour of the Basque Country was marred by a horrific crash in which Jonas ­Vingegaard broke a ­collarbone and ­several ribs and also sustained a ­pulmonary contusion and a ­pneumothorax. The crash happened at a turn on a high-speed descent and the race leader, ­Primoz Roglic, was forced to ­abandon, while Remco Evenepoel ­suffered a fracture to his right ­collarbone and his right shoulder blade.
“I think the most dangerous part of cycling is the riders themselves,” the Dutchman told a press ­conference for Sunday’s race. “We take the risks and that’s the main problem, ­everyone wants to be at the front in the same place and it’s not possible. We can change a lot of things to make it better, but it’s never going to be completely secure.”
Van der Poel won his third Tour of Flanders last Sunday, and this ­weekend the world champion is favourite for Paris-­Roubaix as he seeks to defend the title. Race organisers have ­implemented a chicane in an effort to slow the riders down as they head into the notorious cobbled Trouée d’Arenberg, one of the most dangerous sections of the Hell of the North. After the change was announced a few days before the race, Van der Poel responded to a video of the chicane posted on social media platform X by asking: “Is this a joke?” – and the rider is still not convinced.
“I think it’s good that they’re trying something. But in my opinion, the chicane is not the right solution and also to do it in the week before the race is not the best option either,” he said. “Obviously, it’s one of the most dangerous places of the season, so it’s good that they’re thinking about change, but for me change isn’t always the best thing to do. If you go into Arenberg in 20th position, it’s pretty good, you’re still in the race, but if you go into the chicane in 20th position, I think everyone who is after positions five to 10 will get stuck and then you easily lose 30 seconds.”
Van der Poel’s belief that riders themselves are the biggest danger will not, however, see him change his tactics for the race as he pursues his sixth Monument title. “Like I said, the riders are the main issue, but I’m also joining the party, if you want to win, you have to be where everyone wants to be at the crucial moments.”Too often cemeteries for enslaved people have been all but erased from history but how we remember matters
For archeologists, what defines people as human is how we bury our dead. Imagine, then, a society that relegates a whole community as legally inhuman, enslaved with no rights. In spite of slavery, African burial grounds are tangible reminders of the enslaved and free – defying oppressive circumstances by reclaiming people’s humanity through acts of remembrance.
When I first visited the British overseas territory of St Helena in 2018 and saw the burial ground in Rupert’s Valley, I was astounded by its size and significance. It unambiguously placed the island at the centre of the Middle Passage – tying the British empire to the institution of slavery in the US, the Caribbean, and globally.
During my time on the island, I spoke to many community and government stakeholders, who sometimes seemed hard-pressed to reconcile their sense of “Britishness” with acknowledging their history linked to the transatlantic slave trade.
I was brought there because of a similar struggle that began 34 years ago: to preserve a burial ground in the heart of Lower Manhattan, the New York African burial ground. I led the fight alongside many others to realise a monument honouring the memory of thousands of enslaved and free Africans.
Today, I am a global expert specialising in protecting and memorialising African burial grounds. Here are five other historical burial sites around the world. How we choose to remember these places matters. They are sites of reclamation and resistance, where revolutionary acts of remembrance will for ever mark our cultural landscape.
The “Slaves Burying Place” held more than 36 enslaved Africans who lived and died in bondage to Dutch colonial settlers farming in northern Manhattan’s Inwood neighbourhood. Even in death, they were dehumanised by laws prohibiting their burial in consecrated grounds with their enslavers. A newspaper reported in 1903 the unceremonious excavation of the burial ground to make way for a road. Bones were reportedly taken for souvenirs and by the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). When the site was marked for development, the Bowery Residents Committee (BRC) learned of the history and the injustice, with the desire for justice prompting a halt to further planning. Various stakeholders were engaged, including descendant communities of enslaved and Indigenous peoples, community residents, leaders, historians, and advocates, and the Dyckman Farmhouse Museum. Discussions for the repatriation of human remains from the AMNH and a memorial are under way.
Also known as the Old Slaves’ Burying Ground and Coloured cemetery, it was once owned by the Second Asbury African Methodist Episcopal church, torn down by vandals in the 1880s. The site was seized in 1954 under questionable circumstances and was paved over in the 1960s. A shopping plaza now stands where people were buried. More than 1,000 people were interred during the life of the cemetery, until 1916. The last person born into slavery on Staten Island, Benjamin Prine, was buried at age 99. His descendants now fight to repair the historical injustice and reclaim the site and the humanity of those lying there.
Farmer Street cemetery, owned by the city of Newnan, Georgia, just south of Atlanta, was used for enslaved and free Black people. Newnan had a notorious reputation for the lynching of Sam Hose, who was accused of killing a white man during a dispute over money and raping his wife. Hose was captured, dragged from custody and lynched the next day without trial; his body was burned and dismembered, with parts given out as trophies. In 2021, community leaders protested against the City’s indifference to the site, organising a march from the cemetery to the town centre to deliver messages of protest at the foot of a Confederate statue. At the heart of the issue was the city’s neglect of the cemetery and encroachment by a multimillion-dollar skatepark. The city honours and maintains a Confederate cemetery, without according the same respect to the Black cemetery.
In 2021 and based on a 1781 map of the island of Sint Eustatius, in the Dutch Caribbean, archaeologists excavated the remains of the former Golden Rock plantation quarters for enslaved Africans. Protests against the excavations by the community of Sint Eustatius led to increased awareness and attention to the island’s African cultural heritage. The controversial excavations generated a movement by descendants to research their past of enslavement, including making an inventory from archive sources of the inhabitants of African descent from the Golden Rock plantation. Community activists, including the St Eustatius Afrikan Burial Ground Alliance, have been instrumental in leading the charge and raising awareness as a way of reclaiming the sites and humanity of the enslaved people buried on private properties and public lands across the island.
Cotton Dike cemetery, known as the “slave cemetery”, was located on the former Sams Plantation, which occupied Dataw Island, Beaufort, near St Helena, South Carolina. The Sams family exploited and forced African labourers to cultivate Sea Island cotton and indigo for Britain. The cemetery was used from 1785 to 1967 by generations of enslaved and free Africans. In 2004, possibly for a land-use survey, community stakeholders were interviewed amid plans to develop a “premier residential community and golf club”, further isolating the cemetery from any cultural connection. By 2007, the year the African Burial Ground National Monument opened in New York, Andrew Robinson, a Dataw native and New York resident, and his brother Nathan campaigned to raise a monument honouring their family in Cotton Dike cemetery. Signage was negotiated with the approval of Dataw Historic Foundation History & Learning Center, the designated steward of the site on behalf of the development, and a rededication ceremony was held. Access to the site is through a private residential development, which can isolate cultural identity and present challenges over who gets to tell this story.From Puerta del Sol plaza in Madrid to the Tuileries Garden in Paris, guides reshape stories continent tells about itself
Dodging between throngs of tourists and workers on their lunch breaks in Madrid’s Puerta del Sol plaza, we stop in front of the nearly 3-tonne statue depicting King Carlos III on a horse. Playfully nicknamed Madrid’s best mayor, Carlos III is credited with modernising the city’s lighting, sewage systems and rubbish removal.
Kwame Ondo, the tour guide behind AfroIbérica Tours, offers up another, albeit lesser-known tidbit about the monarch. “He was one of the biggest slave owners of his time,” says Ondo, citing the 1,500 enslaved people he kept on the Iberian peninsula and the 18,500 others held in Spain’s colonies in the Americas. As aristocratic families sought to keep up with the monarch, the proportion of enslaved people in Madrid swelled to an estimated 4% of the population in the 1780s.
It is a nod to the kind of conversation – one often neglected or wilfully ignored across the continent – that Ondo and his counterparts in Europe are steadily wedging into everyday life. From Barcelona to Brussels, London to Lisbon, a cohort of guides has trained its lens on Black and African history, laying bare how the continent has been shaped by colonialism and slavery as they reshape the stories that Europe tells about itself. While California debates reparation bills aimed at compensating for generations of discriminatory policies, and the UK takes down tributes to slave traders and colonialists, similar conversations have been conspicuously absent across much of the continent.
“We’re not lifting up anyone’s mattresses,” says Ondo. “This is history hidden in plain sight.”
It is a statement that in some ways mirrors his own life. Born in Equatorial Guinea – the last Spanish colony to claim independence, in 1968 – he grew up in southern Spain, steeped in the culture of a former empire that had long ceased to remember its actions in what has been dubbed the “forgotten colony” of Spain.
Ondo and his family’s existence in Spain, however, acted as a powerful counter to this forgetting. “It was a conscious decision by European powers to disconnect themselves from the history,” says Ondo. “But history comes back to you.”
Eleven hundred miles away, the sentiment is echoed by Jennifer Tosch, who launched Black Heritage Tours in Amsterdam in 2013. The previous year, Tosch had arrived in the country as an international student from the US with a singular Dutch connection; with family roots that trace back to Suriname, she had family who had been living in the Netherlands for four generations.
Her attempts to explore this connection were futile – the result of what she describes as “wilful forgetting” or “colonial amnesia” – and convinced her of the need to bring the city’s hidden histories to the masses.
“Imagine me sitting here in courses, being told that your history wasn’t included, that you didn’t matter,” she says. “That there was nothing here for you to see that would bring you closer to an understanding about your past. It just didn’t sit right.”
As she geared up to tour visitors and locals past the gable stones that include the image of a servile, Black child and the dark-skinned figureheads with exaggerated features once used to signal pharmacies, the idea was initially met with scepticism by Dutch people of colour.
“Like: ‘No, no, there was no Black history here; no, there was no Black presence until much later’,” she says. “So questioning the notions of belonging and citizenship and identity were interwoven with my mission to prove that we belong here. And that our stories matter.”
Eleven years on, the conversation around Black history and colonialism in the Netherlands has shifted. In 2023, King Willem-Alexander apologised for his country’s role in slavery but stopped short of heeding demands for reparations, despite research suggesting his ancestors had earned the modern-day equivalent of €545m (£466m) from slavery.
The apology was a “pretty watershed moment”, says Tosch, albeit one that was carefully timed to dovetail with the growing attention being paid to this history. In other words, it was more a credit to the crucial work many had been doing to uncover the history than any royal initiative, she says.
In Berlin, this kind of shift feels a long way off, says Justice Mvemba, who founded Decolonial Tours in 2022.
The locals who take her tours are often surprised to find out that Germany’s colonial empire once ranked as the third largest in Europe. “They’ve never learned anything about Germany’s colonial past, some don’t even know that the Berlin conference happened in Berlin,” she says, citing the 1884-85 gathering in which European imperial powers wrangled for control of Africa. “I think it is also shocking to them how those colonial continuities just live among us.”
Mvemba, who was born in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and raised in Germany, points to a potent example: Berlin’s African quarter, conceived in the late 19th century as a place where the city could host a permanent zoo that would exhibit both wild animals and humans in order to celebrate Germany’s colonial project.
While the zoo never came about, echoes of it resurfaced more than 100 years later, when a zoo in Bavaria sought to attract visitors by creating an “African village” that included performers and artisans.
The initiative went ahead despite widespread protests by anti-discrimination groups, Mvemba says, hinting at how Germany – a country often lauded for its efforts to deal with its more-recent past – had failed to meaningfully reckon with its history of colonialism. “So really, these tours are about making people reflect and realise that we are still living those colonial biases or reproducing them,” she says.
These efforts to connect the dots between the past and present come at a critical time for the continent, says Julia Browne. In 1994, she launched Walking the Spirit Tours, leading locals and visitors to Paris through the histories of those who had enabled slavery and confronted colonialism.
“It opens another chapter in the book of exploring French history – and European as well – and facing the facts, bringing it right out in front so that people can’t deny it,” she says. “And especially at this time, when the right wing is on the rise, the voices just have to keep getting stronger and stronger.”
In countries such as Italy, the Netherlands and Portugal, far-right parties have broken through to become key players in politics. In France and Germany, nativist parties are climbing steadily up the polls, pulling mainstream parties to the right as they compete for the attention of voters.
“They have a certain rhetoric and narration that creates fear in people, creates fear of what used to be called ‘the other’. And it gives the sense that people don’t belong if they’re not of European origin,” she says. “But it’s important for the other side to be heard, that, no, this is not the truth.”
She points to Place de la Concorde, set to be showcased to the world this summer during the Olympic Games. “But what else is there? There’s a place called Hôtel de la Marine. It’s a gorgeous building that’s been renovated, but it was in there that the system of slavery and colonialism was managed,” she says, describing it as an “administrative headquarters” for the country’s colonial empire before it was written into history as the location where the decree abolishing slavery in the colonies was signed in 1848.
Nearby, is the Tuileries Garden. “It was there that slavery in the colonies was first abolished by the National Convention, but also re-established by Napoleon,” says Browne. “If you’re a person of colour, or have origins in the islands or origins in colonial Africa, these places are part of your history.”
In Madrid, Ondo’s walking tour begins to wrap up after crossing a crowded plaza where people were once sold to the highest bidder and visiting a church teeming with tourists seemingly oblivious to the symbols linked to enslavement carved into its stone walls.
His last stop, however, is at a changing roster of African restaurants in the city centre. It’s an ending with a dual purpose: showcasing the vibrant clutch of restaurants, including Senegalese and Equatorial Guinean, that have sprung up in recent years, and reinforcing how the stories of the past continue to colour life in Madrid today.
“All this is not really a thing of the past, it’s a thing that is still going on at the moment,” he says, pointing to the power that continues to be wielded by those whose families profited from slavery, to the companies that have supplanted colonial empires in extracting resources from the global south, and the EU’s crackdown on those risking their lives to cross the Mediterranean in small boats.
“It’s a never-ending process,” Ondo says. “It’s a transformation of the same issues of 200 years ago. Projects like mine and many others kind of open up a conversation about these things.”British overseas territory may face legal action over alleged failure to honour reburial plan after remains found during airport project
A British overseas territory is being urged to return the remains of 325 formerly enslaved people to their ancestral kingdoms in Africa, or potentially face legal action.
The remains were excavated in 2008 when an access road to a new airport was being built on the remote South Atlantic Ocean island of St Helena. They were held in storage for 14 years before being reburied.
A master plan was drawn up for a “dignified reburial” and memorialisation and to protect up to 10,000 other remains in the African burial ground in Rupert’s Valley from which they were removed, described as “the most significant physical remaining trace of the transatlantics slave trade on Earth”.
Despite endorsing the plan, the St Helena government, led by an appointee of the UK Foreign Office, has failed to honour it, according to its co-authors, Annina van Neel and Peggy King Jorde. They cite the lack of a memorial marking the site where the 325 were reburied and the fact that a national conservation area has not been created to protect the original burial ground.
Van Neel, who was the airport project’s environment officer when the bones were uncovered, has enlisted the help of State of the African Diaspora (Soad) to repatriate the 325 and prevent further desecration of the site.
The St Helena claim is one of many issued this month by Soad, which is recognised by the African Union, seeking restitution from countries including the UK, institutions and individuals.
Van Neel, whose fight for a proper reburial of the remains is detailed in the film Buried, published by the Guardian on Tuesday as part of the Cotton Capital project, said: “As a young African woman finding something that she didn’t even know she’d lost – finding a piece of her identity, of her history – I’m still trying to make sense of how global and yet how personal this whole significant site is.
“I always used to say, I don’t want to make this political, and then I think with the reburial I realised how political it really is, because who has charge of this heritage of the sacred site, and who has claimed charge of it?
“And that’s why, for me, I had to take it back to Soad, to take it back to the African continent, to some sort of authority that I and those remains would deem their own authority – those people in the ground that can’t speak for themselves.”
St Helena’s £285m airport was intended to help connect one of the most isolated inhabited islands with the rest of the world. It was once labelled the “world’s most useless airport” because high winds made landings difficult.
Those buried, including 3,000 children, were victims of the “middle passage”, and were among more than 25,000 Africans who were removed from illegal Portuguese slave vessels and quarantined on St Helena during British abolition efforts in the mid-19th century.
Although labelled “liberated Africans”, many were shipped on to the British West Indies to continue working for the crown as indentured labour. Those who stayed – and died – on St Helena were confined in overcrowded and unsanitary conditions, employed in the lowest economic occupations and lacked food.
King Jorde, who visited St Helena at Van Neel’s request because of her experience in fighting to preserve African burial grounds in the US, said part of the reason repatriation was necessary was that “the United Kingdom insists upon considering these people liberated when they were not and [it is] perpetuating a lie about what actually happened to them”.
She described contested burial sites as “battlegrounds” and said efforts to preserve them were a “revolutionary act of remembrance”.
In support of their various claims, Soad and the International Commission on Heritage and Culture (ICHC), which have been mandated by many states, nations and indigenous territories, cite various international codes and conventions. They include the Unesco convention on the means of prohibiting and preventing the illicit import, export and transfer of ownership of cultural property; the Unidroit convention on stolen or illegally exported cultural objects; the code of ethics for museums, and a 2019 European parliament resolution to identify and recover looted art.
More claims will follow the letters already sent as part of what Soad and the ICHC are calling a “class diplomatic action”. They have said that if their requests for “open dialogue” are not complied with – recipients have 30 days to reply – they are “ready to take this matter to the international courts”.
The letters state: “We are calling on the western nations and related entities to restitute and return the stolen, looted, pillaged cultural goods, works of art and human remains which were taken unlawfully and return back to the rightful legal and lawful owners.
“We also make this call with respect to African and indigenous American Indian human remains which are unceremoniously laying in western burial grounds, such as on the Island of St Helena, as an example.”
Van Neel contrasted the efforts taken on St Helena to preserve Napoleon’s empty tomb – which has a trust overseeing it – with the treatment of the African burial site.
King Jorde said of the site: “It’s part of the larger story for those of us who are descendants [of enslaved people] living in America and recognise what the transatlantic slave trade was all about. It’s sort of that missing link.”
A St Helena government spokesperson said it was considering the Soad letter but that “significant progress” had been made towards delivering the recommendations of the master plan, describing it as “a live document containing multiple phases of delivery”.
They said work was continuing to fund and build a memorial and interpretation in Rupert’s Valley, adding that the burial sites “have been formally recognised and allocated plot numbers in the Land Registry. As parcelled land belonging to the crown estate, no development is permitted at these sites, avoiding any further disturbance.”A braid from a formerly enslaved African buried on the island was the catalyst for Annina van Neel’s work to preserve and share these histories
At the end of January 2012, I arrived on St Helena after a six-day journey by ship from Cape Town. After being surrounded by water for nearly a week, the sight of land on the midnight-blue horizon was overwhelming. It was as though someone had forgotten their piece of land in the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean. 47 square miles of volcanic rock, 2,810 miles from the coast of Brazil and 1,610 miles from Angola – an oasis in a desert, an enigma.
I arrived on the island as part of the project team constructing St Helena’s first airport. Previously accessible only by sea, this incredible community, which had been defined by its isolation as an outpost and a place of exile for 500 years, would for the first time be easily reached by the rest of the world.
The scale and significance of the project was colossal. As the environmental officer, my role would be to make sure the build complied with regulations regarding an array of issues, including marine protection, flora and fauna conservation, the mitigation of noise, dust and air pollution, waste management, and the preservation of built and cultural heritage. It was an immense privilege and responsibility. I knew it would be complicated, but what I was severely unprepared for was encountering human remains.
Between 1840 and 1872, more than 25,000 enslaved Africans were brought on to St Helena from slaving voyages intercepted by the British Navy. About one-third died shortly after and were buried on the island in unmarked graves.
Four years before I arrived, an archaeological excavation of 325 articulated human remains was carried out, to make way for the road leading to the airport. I had researched and delivered training on these burial grounds in Rupert’s Valley, where construction would take place, but somehow I was still not prepared. There was an impenetrable membrane separating me from the humanity of those bones.
This separation was constellated with dates, numbers, scientific explanations, construction programmes and deadlines. By excavating this history, I was personally scraping away generations of forgetting. My first encounter was eight months in. Right on the boundary of the construction site, we found a set of human remains.
My first glimpse of them was in a box, collected by someone more senior than me. Not resembling anything human in my mind, not in where they were found, or how they were collected. Utterly insignificant.
I had not expected this encounter. Somehow, until this point, the probability of it happening had been non-existent in my mind. As the environmental officer, I felt deeply responsible for disturbing the most significant physical trace of the transatlantic slave trade. Then I realised it was inevitable: how could a project of this size not encroach on a space that was unmarked and uncelebrated? I carried out mitigation works to protect the site from further destruction, erected a simple barricade – and continued working as if this event meant nothing to me.
But I couldn’t let it go. I grew up in Namibia, a country with a history of trauma rooted in colonialism, genocide and slavery under German rule and more recently an apartheid regime under South African rule. Now I found myself struggling to negotiate the relationship between my own identity, the identity of those lying in the ground or in boxes, and the identity of an idyllic community whose own history is woven into a rich tapestry of colonialism, slavery and the slave trade.
The remains of the 325 people excavated in 2008 had been temporarily placed in boxes and stored for future reburial. Exhumed with them were their most prized possessions: pieces of them that, in time, become pieces of me, now gathered ready to be displayed in a museum exhibition in Liverpool. I stared at them and felt everything fading away.
I could see only the hair that looked like mine. The most delicate, perfect braid, found with one of the 325 men, women and children. Impeccably preserved. The braid was no more than 5cm in length and 4mm in width, held in a museum glass case on a bed of foam. A colour between clove and cocoa. Perfect. I saw my grandmother’s braids. I felt the inside of my mother’s knees against my cheeks while seated on the carpet in front of the TV on a Sunday afternoon. She was braiding my hair for school the next day. I wanted to touch the braid so desperately, make it more real than what I was feeling inside.
This one braid had the power to turn those bones into people like me. People with lived lives and moments that made them so human. In that moment I knew that I was in a privileged position, to have sight of something so sacred. In the middle of the South Atlantic Ocean, on this island, in that museum, in that room, in that case, in 5cm and 4mm, in that moment there was more humanity and connection to another than I had ever experienced. I felt humbled and honoured, hope and fear, alone and connected, all at once. I wanted to share this feeling, that made me feel so alive and numb at the same time. That made my heart beat faster and slower all at once.
This was the closest I had felt to humanity, to belonging. I felt as if I belonged here, in the boxes and buried in the dirt, more than I had felt in all my existence. But although I belong, this feeling does not belong to me. I am only the medium: this has to be channelled, communicated. And with every ounce of my being, it must be protected.
I realised I could not do this alone. It would demand all my physical, emotional and spiritual capacity. I reached out to Peggy King Jorde, the woman who 30 years earlier had fought for the African American Burial Ground in the heart of New York City. A desperate online search would tether me to a sister in the struggle.
It felt like connecting with a source that was created over generations to address exactly the situation that we found ourselves in. Connected by our shared history.
I did not choose this path, it chose me, and continues to choose me every day. I feel as though my arrival on the island was in response to a call, an echo. I resigned from my position on the construction project to work with the St Helena National Trust and lead work on memorialising the African heritage in Rupert’s Valley.
I collaborated with the community to recreate the scenes of the burial grounds and replicate their beads with local jewellers. We held community meetings that would allow for uncomfortable discussions in a safe environment. I spent the next 10 years fighting for a proper reburial that would honour the 325. All of these things that would help this community connect with the outside world, not through air access, but through a shared human story.
All of these actions and little deeds would decolonise and reconnect me to the most significant trace of my humanity. After a decade of living on the rock in the middle of the South Atlantic, I returned to Namibia. I will keep fighting to protect other African burial grounds. The lost girl who moved to the island 12 years ago has been buried. Now, I walk with the descendants of millions, the diaspora, and the most significant trace is within me.In the state of La Guajira, ambitious plans to transition to renewables are beset by bureaucratic delays and anger from many local Indigenous people, who see it as ‘new colonialism’
A few years ago, as age began to take its toll, Rosa Velásquez decided it was time to leave the restaurant she owned in the coastal town of Cabo de la Vela and move back home for a peaceful retirement.. However, when she returned to the tiny rural community of Jotomana, on the arid plains of Colombia’s northernmost tip, she found the place she and her ancestors had called home for generations littered with giant wind turbines.
Towering white turbines punctuate the horizon a few miles from Cabo de la Vela. The region, in the northern state of La Guajira, is home to all of Colombia’s windfarms and its largest Indigenous population, the Wayúu.
“We live among turbines. The companies like them, but I don’t. Where am I to go if this is my territory? What are my grandchildren going to do once I die?” asks Velásquez, a Wayúu herself, as goats roam around her property under the blistering sun.
La Guajira, Colombia’s second-poorest state, has become the focal point and battleground of the government’s proposed energy transition, a push to develop renewable energy sources and reduce its dependency on oil and coal to tackle the climate crisis.
According to La Guajira’s chamber of commerce, the state has solar radiation levels 60% higher than the national average and wind speeds double the global norm. Private companies and Colombia’s mines and energy ministry had sought to capitalise on these factors – even before Gustavo Petro’s leftist government set out its ambitions for a “just energy transition”.
The renewables sector could see investments reach $2.2bn (£1.75bn) this year, much of that being funnelled into the region. La Guajira has 17 renewable energy projects in development, with plans for dozens more to follow – including many offshore windfarms.
The Bogotá-based development organisation Indepaz, which has long tracked the development of renewable energy in La Guajira, has found 57 windfarm projects in various stages of completion.
When Colombia’s energy ministry began fostering the renewables industry in 2019, under Petro’s conservative predecessor Iván Duque, it was hoped such projects would make up 15% of the national power supply by 2023.
However, those ambitious plans have not yet materialised. By the end of last year, less than 2% of Colombia’s power came from non-conventional renewable sources, such as wind or solar.
In Colombia, the development of windfarms is a cumbersome process, with most projects facing severe obstacles and long delays. In July, the energy ministry admitted that 82% of windfarm projects in La Guajira were behind schedule.
Industry bodies share concerns over the pace of development. SER Colombia revealed in January that 65% of projects across the country forecast to begin operations this year were delayed, many significantly.
Bureaucracy means that small renewable energy projects in Colombia typically take three to six years to become operational, according to SER Colombia.
The delays are so bad that several companies have scrapped their plans altogether. The Italian energy company Enel announced last May that it was “indefinitely suspending” the construction of its 200MW Windpeshi project – which stagnated for months with just 35% of the work completed – while Colombia’s Celsia is contemplating the sale of its two stalled projects in La Guajira.
Resistance from Indigenous communities is one reason for the delays to the region’s windfarms, says Aníbal Mercado, head of the regional Wayúu council, known as a Pütchipü’üi or a Palabrero. He blames the failure by companies and the government to enter into dialogue with local people and understand the complexities of La Guajira.
“The rights of the communities have been violated,” he says, blaming the authorities for not explaining the effects, protecting local small businesses, and not respecting land rights or the “spiritual and cultural aspects that sustain these communities”.
Irene Vélez, a former mines and energy minister under Petro, says one of her concerns while leading the government’s energy transition efforts was that officials and industry failed to appreciate the need for a good understanding of local communities to operate successfully in the region.
“From the beginning, I insisted that these projects’ difficulties weren’t technical but social,” says Vélez.
Under Duque, she says, energy companies were required to funnel only 1% of their royalties from renewable projects back into affected communities. She increased that figure to 6%.
“The auctions for construction permits did not consider adequate distribution of benefits for local communities,” Vélez says.
“They perceive these projects as having the same exploitative dynamic of the old [extractivist] model and do not see benefits. So, of course, they oppose them,” she says.
Dialogue between the area’s different communities is another challenge. Indigenous people in La Guajira are widely dispersed among rural communities, or rancherías, that often struggle to agree on windfarm development.

“There is no unity between us; there are many differences between families and communities,” says Luis Arturo Barliza, who represents the tiny windswept community of Casa Eléctrica, where it has been proposed to site a windfarm.
Although he considers windfarms to be “good business”, he is caught in a family feud over a windfarm on their territory. “We need to manage it well for things to be done equitably. But now, things don’t seem to be going that way,” says Barliza.
Isabel Preciado, an energy and climate researcher at the environmental organisation Censat Agua Viva, says: “The approach is woeful because they [government and companies] ignore the territorial context and the complex organisation among the Wayúu.”
Nonetheless, not all Indigenous people in the area are against windfarms. Elva María Velásquez recalls her mother walking out, machete in hand, to meet company representatives and express her opposition to windfarms on her land. Despite her resistance, however, the family moved out a few years ago to make way for the Guajira 1 windfarm.
Velásquez now lives near the farm in a new home built by the company. She is glad to have a brick house with a solar panel, a new kitchen and freezer; it is a significant upgrade from the simple wooden hut she lived in before.
For many people in La Guajira, who feel perennially ignored by officials in Bogotá, the arrival of private energy companies to their territory has brought development and support that the state has failed to deliver.
Companies have provided fresh drinking water – a resource that rural communities desperately lack – as well as solar panels, generators and improvements to homes and schools. People have also had wiring and sockets installed but, despite promises that electricity would be provided by December, they are still not connected to the grid.
Luis Carlos Iguarán, from the tiny community of Lanshalía, appreciates the changes. “It’s progress for us and our communities because it changes our way of life and conditions, and there will be more opportunities,” he says.
Despite the Petro government’s vow to usher in a new age of green energy, the prospect of such a transition happening through La Guajira is slim – especially considering that the president may have only two years left in office.
Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Indepaz, says: “We don’t have [an energy] transition in Colombia, but rather a diversification of the power grid to supposedly support new energies.”.
She regards the projects as a “new type of colonialism”, stressing: “At the end of the day, it’s business. It has nothing to do with the environment.”
Colombia’s mines and energy ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Vélez, Petro’s former minister, admits that the government’s energy transition “has its challenges”. Yet she believes it is still “the path to follow in this government and hopefully those that follow”.
The government is proposing not only to expand green energy but also to end extractive industries, she says. “That is the most challenging energy transition situation, as some sectors do not want to replace the [current economic] model.”
With the clock ticking for Petro and his promise to steer Colombia towards a greener future, scepticism and frustration are adding to the obstacles his ambitions for the energy sector are already facing, raising further questions about the viability of his environmental agenda.
“Whatever you do in La Guajira – if you do not have the social sensitivity that comes from having been in the territory and getting to know it – is detrimental,” Barney says. “It’s simply money thrown away.”Country needs to speed up environmental response to protect its ageing population, multinational study finds
In 2005 Beijing was crowned the smog capital of the world. Concerns about air pollution and athlete health overshadowed preparations for the 2008 Olympic Games and required industry and traffic shutdowns to clean the air during the event itself.
Now, a team of researchers at Chinese, German and Canadian universities have tracked the impacts of deteriorating air at that time. They found that particle pollution deaths in China were increasing at about 213,000 a year and peaked at 2.6mn people in 2005.
More positively, the impact of rapid improvements in China’s air pollution were also seen, with decreases of 59,000 deaths a year from 2013 to 2019.
Air pollution in China is still far worse than in many developed countries. In 2019, about half of China’s cities failed to meet their own national standards, let alone those from the World Health Organization.
The country now has comprehensive air pollution action plans to win what the government terms the “blue skies defence war”. With big investments in renewable energy and future decarbonisation targets, at first sight, it looks like China has turned a corner.
However, the research contains a warning. Without accelerated action, air pollution deaths in China will begin to rise soon. This is due to a growing ageing population with the underlying vulnerabilities that come in later life.
Prof Michael Brauer from the University of British Columbia, who was not involved in the new research, said: “The same level of air pollution will have a greater impact on an older and less healthy population with increased levels of diseases impacted by air pollution – many of which increase with age. These include lung cancer, diabetes, lung and chronic heart disease.”
The scale of the challenge is clear in the latest research. China’s air pollution-related deaths are projected to increase by between 116,000 and 181,000 a year from 2030 to 2060, despite continued improvements in particle pollution and improvements in health care.
Brauer explained the implications: “So, for the future, for China to even to just tread water, it needs to reduce air pollution even more aggressively.”
In the UK, the effect of an ageing population is also predicted to reduce the gains from measures to reduce air pollution, but a preliminary 2022 study suggests that will not completely outweigh them.
Brauer explained that many other countries face a similar challenge to China: “Even India’s population is ageing, but it will take 20 years to reach the age where China is today. Some of the countries in eastern Europe such as Bulgaria and Poland are highly polluted and have populations that are even older than China’s.” This is especially important as EU governments finalise new legal targets for air pollution.Lending to meat, dairy and feed corporations led to ‘significant proportion’ of banks’ emissions, Friends of the Earth found
American banks are “sabotaging” their own climate commitments by financing meat, dairy and feed corporations, according to a report.
The report analysed funding from 58 US banks to animal protein and feed companies in the form of loans and underwriting, such as share and bond issuance guarantees.
“Banks have committed to pathways to net zero, but they are ignoring a huge cow-shaped hole in their plans,” said Monique Mikhail, the lead author of the report and director of the agriculture and climate finance programme with Friends of the Earth, an NGO.
In emissions terms, the report links more than 24m metric tonnes of CO2 – about equal to the annual exhaust emissions from 5m cars – to animal protein and feed company financing by what it calls the “big three” livestock lenders: Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase.
Livestock-linked financing by all 58 banks totalled more than $134bn between 2016 and 2023, the report found, with more than half of that, about $74bn, coming from the top three financiers.
“We weren’t expecting to see the banks sabotaging their own climate commitments to this level,” Mikhail said, adding that eliminating livestock and feed financing was “one of the most effective, climate-positive choices US banks can make”.
Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase have all committed to reducing the emissions linked to their client financing, and to reaching net zero by 2050, meaning any ongoing emissions are to be balanced by removal projects.
Mikhail said that while “the central fact in the report is that [proportionally] a very tiny part, only a quarter of a per cent, of the big three banks’ lending portfolio goes to meat and dairy and feed companies”, that lending led to a significant portion of their total reported emissions.
The report further warns that the “extent of meat, dairy and feed corporations’ contribution to the banks’ GHG emissions footprints may remain obscured”, even to the banks themselves, because animal protein and feed companies “commonly underreport their emissions”.
Financial institutions, the report said, “widely acknowledge that full GHG disclosures … are critical for making good financial decisions, yet only 22% of [meat, dairy and feed] companies reviewed for this report disclose scope 3 emissions [and] 56% do not report emissions at all”.
Scope 3 refers to indirect emissions from activities related to a company or organisation. For livestock, dairy or feed companies, deforestation was a significant scope 3 emission, said Mikhail. “When you look at meat, dairy and feed companies, scope 3 emissions can be over 90% of their total emissions. For [the Brazilian meat corporation] JBS, scope 3 is up to 97% of their total climate footprint,” she said, referencing the report’s findings.
More broadly, the report found that banks’ financing of animal protein companies such as JBS, estimated to be the world’s highest-emitting livestock company, was enabling their continued expansion and posing “a critical threat” to the Paris agreement goal of keeping global warming to 1.5C (2.7F) above preindustrial levels.

In March, an international survey of experts found that eating less animal protein and farming fewer animals, especially in richer countries, was the best way to reduce livestock emissions.
To calculate bank financing of animal protein and feed companies, the report used information from financial databases, company reports, publications and filings, and media and analyst reports. Between January 2016 and March 2023, the 58 US banks provided financing, credit or underwriting services to at least one of 29 of the livestock or feed corporations included in the analysis.
To calculate emissions from the top meat, dairy and feed companies, the report looked at direct scope 1 and 2 emissions and at indirect scope 3 emissions.
Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase declined to comment on the report. JBS, the International Meat Secretariat, the International Dairy Federation and FEFAC, a feed manufacturer association, did not respond to the Guardian’s requests for comment.Governments across region grappling for response as temperatures soar to unseasonable highs
Thousands of schools in the Philippines have stopped in-person classes due to unbearable heat. In Indonesia, prolonged dry weather has caused rice prices to soar. In Thailand’s waters, temperatures are so high that scientists fear coral could be destroyed.
A “historic heatwave” is being experienced across south-east Asia, according to Maximiliano Herrera, a climatologist and weather historian. In updates posted on X, he said heat that was unprecedented for early April had been recorded at monitoring stations across the region this week, including in Minbu, in central Myanmar, where 44C was recorded – the first time in south-east Asia’s climatic history that such high temperatures had been reached so early in the month. In Hat Yai, in Thailand’s far south, 40.2 C was reached, an all-time record, while Yên Châu in north-west Vietnam hit 40.6C, unprecedented for this time of year.
The latest intense weather follows warnings last month by the World Meteorological Organization that the region had also been “gripped by severe heat conditions” in February when temperatures frequently soared into the high-30s – well above the seasonal average. It attributed the scorching weather to human-induced climate change, as well as the El Niño event, which brings hotter, drier conditions to the region.
“The level of heat the globe has experienced over the last 12 months, both on the land and in the ocean has surprised science,” said Prof Benjamin Horton, the director of the Earth Observatory of Singapore. “We always knew we were going to be headed in this direction with our increasing greenhouse gases, but the fact that we’re shattering all these records in 2023, and 2024, is perhaps slightly ahead of time.”
“We’re just not prepared. There’s very few, if any, places in the world that are resilient to this type of heat,” he said, adding that societies needed to adapt.
Governments across the region are grappling with how to respond. In the Philippines, almost 4,000 schools have suspended in-person classes as the heat index passed 42C in some areas, a dangerous level that the weather bureau warned could cause heat cramps and exhaustion.
During the Easter week in Manila, children played in portable pools set up in the streets to try to stay cool.
“Our classrooms are not resilient in this kind of weather. We have a ratio of one to 60-70 students in a classroom that does not have proper ventilation,” said Ruby Bernardo, the president of the teaching union the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) in the National Capital Region. In a recent survey by the union, 90% of teachers said they had just two fans in a classroom to stay cool.
Teachers also reported experiencing dizziness and headaches, and said students were unable to focus and, at worst, had suffered health problems, including nose bleeds. ACT has called for the school timetable to be shifted back to its pre-pandemic schedule, so that students are on breaks during the hottest months – something the government is gradually implementing. It also wants greater investment in hiring teachers and building more climate-resilient classrooms.
“This is not a long-term solution for them to always suspend classes or to have alternative or flexible learning during the [hot] season,” said Bernardo.
Horton said schools and businesses needed to find ways to adapt – by encouraging people to wear looser, comfortable clothing, and by shifting their schedules so that people were at work, and children educated, earlier or later in the day when temperatures were less intense. “Even if we made a snap choice today to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions we’re going to have to deal with [high temperatures] for at least 50 years,” he said, adding that greater effort was needed to educate the public on how and where to stay cool.
The intense heat has also caused havoc in agriculture. In Indonesia, which experienced prolonged dry weather last year, President Joko Widodo resorted to ordering the military to help farmers plant rice when rains finally arrived in December. The cost of rice, a staple food for the country’s 270 million people, rose more than 16% in February compared with last year, according to a Reuters report. Queues for government-subsidised rice have stretched for hours.
In Vietnam, water levels were so low in canals earlier this year that farmers in some areas reportedly struggled to transport their crops. In Thailand, a fall in crop yields will cause farmers’ debt to increase by 8% this year, according to economic analysis cited by the Bangkok Post. In Malaysia, authorities have deployed cloud seeding in areas affected by lack of rainfall.
Governments have issued health warnings advising people on how to avoid heatstroke, though many workers, especially those in sectors such as agriculture or construction, have little option but to endure the severe heat. In Malaysia in February, a 22-year-old man died due to heatstroke.
The effects of the extreme heat also extend into the region’s waters. Assistant professor Thon Thamrongnawasawat, of the faculty of fisheries at Kasetsart University in Thailand, warned this week on social media that El Niño combined with global warming risked destroying coral and fish in the Gulf of Thailand.
“When compared to the start of April in the previous year, in the eastern area, the water is substantially hotter. It’s strangely hot. Even at night, the temperature was a scorching 31.5 degrees,” he said.
“Travelling to Thailand’s seaside soon could become soaking up the sun and dip into onsen. That would be a new slogan,” he said.
If the heat continued for another two or three weeks, he feared coral bleaching could take place. Excessively heated water also threatened the life of fish in local fish farms, and risked creating huge debts for farmers.
There are ways to help, including by reducing global heating, alleviating problems such as marine pollution, caused by rubbish wastewater. “Even so, we still need to be ready to handle and adjust to such rare hot-water occurrences,” he said. “Prepare yourself. The real boiling sea has arrived.”Teenager was assaulted by several people who fled scene in country’s latest incident of school violence
A 15-year-old boy has died after he was badly beaten in a town south of Paris, in the latest incident of school violence in France.
Thursday’s attack comes at a time of heightened tensions in French schools. Earlier this week a teenage girl was temporarily left in a coma after being beaten outside her school in Montpellier, in the south of the country. In that case, three alleged attackers have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder of a minor, one a girl from the same school.
In the latest incident, which occurred in the town of Viry-Châtillon, about 20km (12 miles) south of Paris, the teenager was attacked by several people as he left school on Thursday afternoon.
The public prosecutor’s office announced the boy’s death on Friday afternoon and said an investigation had been opened into murder and gang assault outside a school.
The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who was visiting a primary school in Paris on Friday morning, said: “We have a form of uninhibited violence among our teenagers and sometimes among increasingly younger ones. Schools needs to be shielded from this. School must remain a sanctuary for our children, for their families, for our teachers.”
“We will be intransigent against all forms of violence.”
The schoolboy went into cardiorespiratory arrest, a police source said. He was taken to Necker hospital in Paris.
The prosecutor Grégoire Dulin said in a statement that the attack on the teenage boy happened between 4pm and 4.30pm on Thursday. He said the 15-year-old was “violently attacked by several individuals” and “was discovered by a passerby badly injured in a road near his middle-school”.
The boy was taken to hospital and had emergency surgery on Thursday night, but the prosecutor said he had died on Friday afternoon. An autopsy will be carried out.
The assailants “tried to massacre him”, said Jean-Marie Vilain, the mayor of Viry-Châtillon, calling them “the worst kind of thugs”. “This extreme violence is becoming commonplace,” he added. Psychological help would be provided to pupils and teachers at the school, the mayor added.
According to a police source, the teenager was beaten by several people who then fled.
The school is in a working-class district of Viry-Châtillon, home to about 30,000 people. No arrests had been made by Thursday evening.
Dozens of messages threatening attacks have been sent to schools around France in recent days.President tours site on Friday, as cranes, ships and divers work to reopen port where up to $200m in cargo moves each day
The port of Baltimore could be partially open again by the end of the month as the US military and partners push to clear the collapsed bridge that blocked the main shipping channel after being rammed by a cargo vessel, and Joe Biden toured the disaster site on Friday.
After getting a firsthand look at efforts to clear away the hulking remains of the collapsed Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, the US president reiterated his calls for Congress to authorize the federal government to cover the cost of rebuilding the bridge “through union labor and American steel”.
Yet he also said his administration was “absolutely committed to ensuring that parties responsible for this tragedy pay to repair the damage and be held accountable to the full extent the law will allow”. And he made it a point to pay tribute to the six construction workers who were killed when the bridge collapsed as they fixed potholes on it.
“Most were immigrants but … were Marylanders, hardworking, strong and selfless,” Biden said of the workers, who were from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Mexico. “To all the families and loved ones who are grieving, we have come here to grieve with you.”
Cranes, ships and diving crews worked to reopen one of the nation’s crucial shipping lanes as Biden prepared to deliver his remarks.
Biden received updates from the US Coast Guard and army corps of engineers and got an aerial view of the wreckage.
Eight workers were filling potholes on the bridge when it collapsed in the middle of the night on 26 March. Two were rescued, but the bodies of only two of the six who died have been recovered.
Biden planned to meet privately with the families of the victims Friday afternoon.
Officials have established a temporary, alternate channel for vessels involved in clearing debris.
The army corps of engineers reported that it hopes to open a limited-access channel for barge container ships and some vessels moving cars and farm equipment by the end of this month and to restore normal capacity to Baltimore’s port by 31 May, the White House said.
As much as $200m in cargo normally moves through Baltimore’s port per day, and it is the leading hub for importing and exporting vehicles.
Of more immediate concern might be covering the costs of cleanup and building a new bridge.
The Federal Highway Administration has provided $60m in “quick release” emergency relief funds to get started. Exactly how much the collapse will cost is unclear, though some experts estimate recovery will take at least $400m and 18 months.
The White House announced on Friday it is asking Congress to authorize the federal government to cover 100% of the collapsed bridge cleanup and reconstruction costs, rather than seeking funding through a separate, supplemental funding request.
The Associated Press contributed reportingBiden visits site of disaster as body of Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval, one of six workers killed, is delivered to family
A third body has been recovered after six construction workers were killed when a cargo ship hit the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, authorities said on Friday. The body of Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval, 38, was found just hours before Joe Biden arrived to get a first-hand look at efforts to clear away the debris.
The Baltimore mayor, Brandon Scott, expressed his gratitude to the first responders while sending condolences to the workers’ families. “This evening the Unified Command announced that divers were able to bring Maynor Yassir Suazo Sandoval, one of the remaining missing workers, home to his family,” read a statement from Scott. “While I take solace in knowing this brings us one step closer to closure, my heart continues to be with all the families still waiting anxiously for their loved ones.”
Eight workers – immigrants from Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador – were filling potholes on the bridge when it was hit by a huge cargo ship and collapsed in the middle of the night of 26 March. Two men were rescued and the bodies of two others were recovered in subsequent days. Authorities said the search for the other victims would continue.
The president met for more than an hour with the families of those killed.
“The damage is devastating and our hearts are still breaking,” Biden said.
Aboard Marine One, Biden circled the warped metal remains and the mass of construction and salvage equipment trying to clear the wreckage of the collapse.
On the ground later, he received a briefing from local officials, the US Coast Guard and the army corps of engineers on the situation in the water and its impacts on the region. The president also greeted police officers who helped block traffic to the bridge in the moments before it was hit by a ship – which helped avert an even larger loss of life.
“I’m here to say your nation has your back and I mean it,” Biden said from the shoreline overlooking the collapsed bridge in Dundalk, just outside Baltimore. “Your nation has your back.”
Officials have established a temporary, alternative channel for vessels involved in clearing debris. The army corps of engineers hopes to open a limited-access channel for barge container ships and some vessels moving cars and farm equipment by the end of this month, and to restore normal capacity to Baltimore’s port by 31 May, the White House says.
That’s important since longer delays in reopening shipping lanes could send shockwaves through the economy. As much as $200mi in cargo normally moves through Baltimore’s port each day, and it is the leading hub for importing and exporting vehicles.
More than 50 salvage divers and 12 cranes are on site to help cut out sections of the bridge and remove them from the key waterway. Officials told Biden they had all the resources they needed to meet the targets for opening the channel into the Baltimore port.
The president announced that some of the largest employers affected by the collapse, including Amazon, Home Depot and Domino Sugar, had committed to keeping their employees on payroll until the port was reopened. That followed days of outreach by state and federal officials to try to mitigate the economic impact.
“From the air, I saw the bridge that has been ripped apart,” Biden said, “but here on the ground I see a community that’s pulled together.”
It is still unclear, though, how the costs of cleanup and building a new bridge will be covered.
The Federal Highway Administration has provided $60m in “quick release” emergency relief funds to get started. Exactly how much the collapse will ultimately cost is unclear, though some experts estimate recovery will require at least $400m and 18 months.
Biden said within hours of the collapse that “the federal government will pay for the entire cost of reconstructing that bridge, and I expect the Congress to support my effort”.Exclusive: Treatments near approval but lack of diagnostic capacity means NHS unprepared for rollout, report says
Hundreds of thousands of dementia patients in England face being denied access to revolutionary new drugs because the diagnostic capacity of the NHS lags behind every other G7 country, according to a damning report.
After decades of research to find a cure for the condition projected to affect 153 million people worldwide by 2050, scientists have successfully developed the first treatments to tackle the underlying causes rather than only relieve the symptoms. Two new drugs could get the green light for use on the NHS within weeks.
However, their effectiveness depends on prompt and early diagnosis of patients. The report, obtained by the Guardian, says the NHS lacks the diagnostic capacity to accurately identify those eligible in time.
The analysis reveals England is unprepared for the rollout of new treatments, with “large gaps in diagnostic capacity” for dementia. It also warns of a £14bn funding black hole that must be plugged if England is to diagnose dementia as quickly as the other G7 countries, the US, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan.
To be eligible for either of the new drugs, lecanemab and donanemab, patients have to be in the early stages of dementia and have had scans to confirm high levels of amyloid in their brain. However, the report says England has the lowest per capita number of PET scanners of any G7 country and the lowest number of MRI scanners. England also has the second-lowest number of dementia specialists needed to diagnose the condition, such as neurologists, old age psychiatrists and geriatricians.
The analysis was produced by experts from organisations including Alzheimer’s Research UK, Alzheimer’s Disease International and the Alzheimer’s Society.
A second study, an NHS briefing paper also seen by the Guardian, estimates that as many as 280,000 patients in England may be eligible for the new treatments if regulators recommend the drugs for use in the health service. However, if the treatments are approved, the NHS would be unprepared for their delivery, the first report says.
“The potential approval of the first of the disease-modifying AD [Alzheimer’s disease] treatments in the UK as early as 2024, and the prospect of subsequent availability in England, shines a light on the stark gap in diagnostic infrastructure needed to provide high-quality dementia care,” it says.
“While future detection and diagnostic technologies might allow for lowering investment levels in later years compared to our projections, the progressive nature of AD means that prolonged wait times would deprive numerous patients of the opportunity to receive a treatment while it will still be effective.”
Dr Susan Mitchell, the head of policy at Alzheimer’s Research UK and a co-author of the report, told the Guardian the NHS had “suffered years of under-investment in diagnostics” and as a result dementia patients were “being left to fall through the cracks”.
“When it comes to diagnosing dementia, timing is everything. Yet right now, too many people are anxiously waiting to get a brain scan or speak to a specialist, and this is stopping them from getting the care and support they deserve. If new Alzheimer’s treatments are approved by regulators, delays to diagnosis could also hurt people’s chances of accessing them, as they are thought to be most effective for those who are in the disease’s earliest stages.”
The most recent NHS figures show fewer than two-thirds of people with dementia (64.5%) have a formal diagnosis – below the government’s target of 67%. People in England wait on average up to two years to receive a diagnosis, and up to four years if under 65.
For the report, the authors compared data and statistics for England with that of the six other countries in the G7. The report found England had the lowest number of PET scanners per 1 million people, at 1.20. Canada has 1.52, Germany has 1.63, France has 2.48, Italy has 3.55, Japan has 4.70, and the US has 5.45.
England also has the lowest number of MRI scanners per 1 million people (6.31), while Canada has 10.06, France has 15.38, Italy has 30.22, Germany has 34.47, the US has 40.44, and Japan has 55.21.
When it comes to dementia specialists, England also fares badly, with 5.04 per 100,000 people, according to the report. Only Canada has a worse record (4.94). France has 6.46, the US has 8.82, Japan has 11.08, and Italy has 15.58. Germany has almost five times as many as England (24.02).
It is estimated that only 2% of people getting a dementia diagnosis in England have access to gold standard tests, the report says.

NHS England officials said dementia diagnosis rates were at their highest for three years. Staff had worked hard to recover services after the Covid-19 crisis when people were less likely to come forward for care, they said.
Mitchell said that without an overhaul of the diagnosis system, people in the earliest stages of dementia could be at risk of missing out on the first-of-a-kind treatments.
“It will be impossible to improve either early or accurate diagnosis without addressing gaps in the workforce and infrastructure – and this research shows just how far England has to go,” she said. “It is shocking to see us sitting at the bottom of the G7 tables for PET and MRI capacity, and only slightly better in terms of staffing. Investment in NHS staff, equipment and facilities is needed to turn the tide.”
The number of people living with dementia in the UK is predicted to rise from 944,000 to 1.6 million by 2050. “This is a crisis that should be at the top of the prime minister’s priority list,” said Mitchell.
The Department of Health and Social Care said it was working to identify and treat more people with dementia, and offer new treatments as they became available.
A spokesperson said: “NHS England is working on improving dementia diagnosis in care homes and taking steps to secure additional diagnostic capacity, including MRI, lumbar puncture and PET-CT scanners.”Some symptoms could be a sign of other conditions so it is important to see a GP if you have concerns
The number of adults living with dementia worldwide is projected to reach 153 million by 2050. With so many of us likely to be affected directly or indirectly, it is vital everyone can spot the signs and are aware of how to get diagnosed.
Dementia is a group of related symptoms associated with an ongoing decline of brain function. There are more than 200 sub-types of dementia, the largest of which is Alzheimer’s disease.
Although most people associate dementia with memory loss, it can also affect the way people speak, think, feel and behave.
Dementia symptoms may include problems with memory loss, thinking speed, mental sharpness, language, understanding, judgment, mood, movement and difficulties doing daily activities.
People with dementia can lose interest in their usual activities or in maintaining relationships, may find social situations difficult, and may lose empathy. They also may not fully understand their environment, or find planning and organising difficult.
The symptoms of dementia typically worsen over time.
If you are concerned about problems with your memory and thinking, contact your GP.
“They’ll give you an initial assessment and may refer you to a local memory service,” says Katie Puckering, the information services manager at Alzheimer’s Research UK. “You’ll then have tests that assess your memory and thinking.
“You may also have a scan to check for changes in your brain. If your results suggest you have dementia, specialists will discuss the findings with you, and you’ll then be able to access the support that is right for you.”
“A person may be reluctant to go to the doctor due to fear or a denial that there is an issue,” says Dr Hilda Hayo, the chief executive of Dementia UK. If this happens, start by explaining that the symptoms may be due to another condition that could be treated, as this may encourage them to see their GP.
“There are many conditions that may mimic the signs of dementia, such as infection, vitamin deficiency and depression,” says Hayo. “It’s often helpful to explain that a prompt assessment and diagnosis leads to the right treatment and support sooner.”
You could also keep a diary of any symptoms over the course of several weeks, suggests Puckering. “A person experiencing these symptoms may not be aware or forget when these things happen,” she says. “Some people find it can be helpful to discuss these changes with their loved ones.”
An initial memory test with a GP is often done with a pen and paper, and will involve a series of questions and tasks, such as recalling a list of words. At the memory clinic, you may have more in-depth tests that assess language, visual and spatial awareness, levels of attention, reasoning and problem solving.
“Brain scans, such as an MRI, can involve lying in a scanner for around an hour,” says Puckering. “This is used to identify changes to the structure of the brain.”
Others may be offered a lumbar puncture. This involves a needle being inserted into your lower back to collect a sample of spinal fluid.
Diagnosing dementia is difficult, especially as early symptoms can be similar to those of other conditions. “But if you or a loved one suspect you have dementia, and have not been referred to a memory clinic, you should seek a second opinion,” says Puckering.
Keep track of symptoms. If they worsen, or new ones develop, see your GP again and let them know about the changes.
“A timely diagnosis can help the person and their family understand what form of dementia they have, how their symptoms affect them, and what they can do to manage them,” says Hayo. “It also enables the person and their family to seek out suitable support, such as financial assistance, forward planning and specialist advice.”
Although there is no cure, an early diagnosis means dementia’s progress can be slowed down in some cases, so the person may be able to maintain their mental function for longer.
With the right treatment and support, many people with dementia are able to lead active, fulfilled lives for longer. “They may also be able to take part in research studies, like clinical trials,” says Puckering.
If you have dementia, or care for someone with the condition, you may be eligible for some benefits if the condition affects your ability to work, or if you have extra costs because of it. In the UK, Citizens Advice offers free, confidential and impartial advice.
It’s hard to predict. It depends on the type, age at diagnosis, and whether there are other medical issues.
“The average life expectancy for people with Alzheimer’s is eight to 10 years, but for people diagnosed in their 80s or 90s, it’s shorter,” says Puckering. “Some people, however, live longer than others, sometimes living up to 15 or 20 years with dementia.”
If you or a loved one has been diagnosed with dementia, keeping physically and mentally active, maintaining a healthy diet, and keeping connected with friends and family can help maintain or improve your health and wellbeing.
There were an estimated 57 million cases worldwide in 2019.
In the UK, 940,000 people are living with a dementia diagnosis. However, the true number affected is probably higher because about a third of people with the condition never get a formal diagnosis. It is the leading cause of death in the UK.
“The latest available data suggests the UK has the lowest per capita rate of diagnosed dementia cases across the G7 nations, with about 1.4% of the population living with dementia,” says Puckering.
Canada has the second lowest rate (1.56%), followed by the US (1.60%), France (1.85%), Germany (2.03%), Italy (2.46%), and Japan (3.25%).
There’s no guaranteed way to prevent dementia. But there is good evidence that a healthy lifestyle can reduce your risk.
That involves eating a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, reducing alcohol consumption, stopping smoking and keeping your blood pressure at a healthy level.Tech company cuts employees from eight offices in Santa Clara in its first big wave of post-pandemic job cuts
Apple is laying off more than 600 workers in California, marking the company’s first big wave of post-pandemic job cuts amid a broader wave of tech industry consolidation.
The iPhone maker notified 614 workers in multiple offices on 28 March that they were losing their jobs, with the layoffs becoming effective on 27 May, according to reports to regional authorities.
The workers were cut from eight offices in Santa Clara, according to the filings under the state’s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, also known as Warn. But it is not clear which departments or projects the employees were involved in.
In February, Apple canceled its multibillion-dollar plans to build an electric car. Executives at the time reportedly told employees that the company was pivoting its resources towards artificial intelligence programs, and layoffs were expected for some staff.
Apple’s electric vehicle program originally intended to build a fully self-driving car, but continually shifted its plans and failed to produce a viable product amid staff turnover and missed deadlines. The company’s decision to fully shutter the program nevertheless surprised employees, according to Bloomberg.
Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment early on Friday.
The Cupertino, California, company had been a notable exception as other tech companies slashed their workforces over the past two years. There was a big surge in hiring during the Covid-19 pandemic, when people spent more time and money online, and big tech companies are still larger than they were before the pandemic. Still, as growth slows, companies are focusing on cutting costs.
In a recent regulatory filing, Apple said it had about 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.
Amazon announced earlier this week a fresh round of layoffs, this time at its cloud computing business AWS. In recent months, the video game maker Electronic Arts said it was cutting about 5% of its workforce, Sony said it was axing about 900 jobs in its PlayStation division, Cisco Systems revealed plans to lay off more than 4,000 workers and the social media company Snap, owner of Snapchat, announced it was slashing 10% of its global workforce.CSIS intelligence report suggests growing number of countries targeting country’s large diaspora populations
Canada’s spy agency has declared that the governments of India and Pakistan probably attempted to meddle in its elections.
As a closely watched public inquiry investigates the scope of foreign interference, on Thursday night the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) released a report suggesting a growing number of countries see Canada – and particularly its large diaspora populations – as a target for subterfuge.
It said India had “intent to interfere and likely conducted clandestine activities” in the 2021 Canadian federal election, including the use of a government proxy agent who attempted to provide illegal financial support to pro-Indian candidates, according to reporting from CBC News.
Proxy agents are a “specific individual who takes explicit and/or implicit direction from a foreign state while obfuscating the link between influence activities and a foreign state”, CSIS said.
It also suggested India targeted electoral districts in which Indo-Canadian voters sympathized with Pakistan or the Khalistan separatist movement.
In 2019, Pakistani government officials in Canada “attempted to clandestinely influence Canadian federal politics with the aim of furthering the Government of Pakistan’s interests in Canada”, CSIS wrote, calling the south Asian country a “limited foreign interference actor”.
The spy agency said the Canadian government conducted a “threat reduction measure” meant to blunt the threat posed by the Pakistan government.
“The situation was monitored and assessed to have effectively reduced the threat of interference,” CSIS said.
Both documents are unclassified summaries and in some cases could be incomplete or rely on uncorroborated, single sources.
The revelations from Canada’s spy agency come as the former Conservative party leader told the inquiry he believed his party lost as many as nine seats because of a foreign misinformation campaign spearheaded by China.
Erin O’Toole resigned as leader after failing to improve his party’s electoral standing.
“The small number of seats would not have impacted the minority government that Canada has right now, but the difference of two, three, five seats may have allowed me more of a moral justification to remain as leader,” O’Toole said, adding he believed some citizens were “intimidated” from voting because the party had a “more traditional, or a more aggressive, foreign policy posture with respect to China”.
The inquiry itself has been the subject of intense public debate. Initially, following reports of Chinese meddling in Canadian elections, the prime minister, Justin Trudeau, appointed David Johnston as special rapporteur to investigate the issue.
Johnston, who previously served as Canada’s governor general, initially caused widespread frustration after he suggested a public inquiry would not be useful because much of the relevant material would remain secret. He later resigned from his role, citing a “highly partisan atmosphere” as political leaders questioned his ties to the prime minister.
In September, the federal government chose Marie-Josée Hogue, a Quebec appeals court judge, to lead a public inquiry “tasked with examining and assessing foreign interference by China, Russia and other foreign states and non-state actors”.
The release of documents suggesting India has sought to undermine the integrity of Canada’s elections does little to ease tensions between the two countries. In September, Trudeau told parliament his government had “credible allegations” that Indian officials were behind the assassination of a prominent Sikh leader in Canada.
The commission has so far heard from lawmakers, the heads of CSIS and the RCMP, the department of global affairs and Canada’s electronic spy agency.Former Australian foreign minister named as secretary general António Guterres’ special envoy to country gripped by civil war
The former Australian foreign minister Julie Bishop has been appointed the United Nations secretary general António Guterres’ special envoy on Myanmar, the world body has said.
Bishop, the Australian National University’s chancellor, will take up the UN role that has been vacant since June last year, when Singaporean diplomat Noeleen Heyzer stepped down.
The UN said in a statement that Bishop had “extensive policy, legal and senior management experience”.
“I am deeply honoured to be appointed special envoy of the secretary general of the United Nations on Myanmar to help deliver on the mandate of the general assembly and the security council resolution of December 2022,” Bishop said in a statement.
The foreign minister, Penny Wong, welcomed the news on Saturday morning.
“Ms Bishop brings a wealth of experience to the role and her appointment comes at a critical time as the political, humanitarian and security situation in Myanmar continues to worsen,” she said.
“The people of Myanmar continue to demonstrate great resolve in the face of unspeakable violence and human rights abuses, and Australia remains resolute in our support for them.”
Wong said the special envoy played a vital role in sustaining international attention and supporting coordinated efforts towards a peaceful resolution in the troubled south-east Asian nation.
Australia would work closely with Bishop, Asean and the international community to build conditions for sustainable peace, she said.
Wong also reiterated the government’s call for the Myanmar regime to “cease violence against civilians, release those unjustly detained, allow safe and unimpeded access for humanitarian assistance and return Myanmar to the path of inclusive democracy”.
The ANU vice-chancellor, Prof Genevieve Bell, also congratulated Bishop on the appointment.
“As Australia’s first female foreign minister, Julie made an incredible contribution to global politics,” Bell said.
“Now, she’s adding special envoy to her illustrious career in global diplomacy. This is a well-deserved recognition of her significant impact on contemporary international relations.”
Myanmar has been in crisis since the army took power from Aung Suu Kyi’s elected government on 1 February 2021.
The country is locked in a civil war between the military on one side and, on the other, a loose alliance of ethnic minority rebels and an armed resistance movement spawned out of the junta’s crackdown on anti-coup protests.
Bishop was Australia’s foreign minister from 2013 to 2018 under prime ministers Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull and Scott Morrison.
She was deputy leader of the Liberal party from 2007 to 2018, before retiring from politics in April 2019.
Bishop became chancellor of ANU in January 2020. She will continue in that role, while also undertaking her work with the UN.Pouria Zeraati said he is back on the airwaves with Iran International, a dissident broadcaster based in the UK
An Iranian journalist who was stabbed outside his London home last week has returned to work, saying the “show must go on”.
Pouria Zeraati was knifed in the leg by a group of three unknown assailants as he approached his car in Wimbledon on 29 March.
The journalist, who works for London-based dissident broadcaster Iran International, has spoken publicly for the first time since the attack and described the stabbing as a “warning shot”. Zeraati told ITV News: “The fact that they just stopped in my leg was their choice to do that.
“They had the opportunity to kill me because the way the second person was holding me and the first person took the knife out, they had the opportunity to stop anywhere they wanted.”
He added: “Whatever the motive was, the show must go on.”
The Metropolitan police has said no arrests have yet been made, but that they are confident suspects “do not present a risk to communities of London or the UK” as detectives believe the three suspects fled the country via Heathrow within hours of the stabbing.
Recalling the attack, Zeraati said he was “approached by a man, who pretended to be actually someone asking for £3 cash”. He added: “They held me strong, very firmly. The first person stabbed me in my leg.
“And those three, four seconds are moments I’ll never forget in my life because the moment I saw the knife in his hand until he stabbed me in my leg, all I was thinking was where he was going to hit, you know, is it going to cut my throat.
“My heart is he’s going to kill me. And then straight after stabbing in, they just started running away.”
Police were called to an address in Wimbledon at 2.49pm on 29 March after reports of a man in his 30s being attacked and sustaining a leg injury.
The Iran International spokesperson, Adam Baillie, said Tehran’s revolutionary guards have been targeting Iran International.
The Farsi-language dissident channel aims to provide independent coverage of Iran, but the Tehran regime has declared it a terrorist organisation. Iran’s charge d’affaires in the UK, Mehdi Hosseini Matin, said: “We deny any link [to the incident].”Parent company Meta also to add ‘high-risk’ label to Al-altered content that deceives the public on ‘a matter of importance’
Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, announced major changes to its policies on digitally created and altered media on Friday, before elections poised to test its ability to police deceptive content generated by artificial intelligence technologies.
The social media giant will start applying “Made with AI” labels in May to AI-generated videos, images and audio posted on Facebook and Instagram, expanding a policy that previously addressed only a narrow slice of doctored videos, the vice-president of content policy, Monika Bickert, said in a blogpost.
Bickert said Meta would also apply separate and more prominent labels to digitally altered media that poses a “particularly high risk of materially deceiving the public on a matter of importance”, regardless of whether the content was created using AI or other tools. Meta will begin applying the more prominent “high-risk” labels immediately, a spokesperson said.
The approach will shift the company’s treatment of manipulated content, moving from a focus on removing a limited set of posts toward keeping the content up while providing viewers with information about how it was made.
Meta previously announced a scheme to detect images made using other companies’ generative AI tools by using invisible markers built into the files, but did not give a start date at the time.
A company spokesperson said the labeling approach would apply to content posted on Facebook, Instagram and Threads. Its other services, including WhatsApp and Quest virtual-reality headsets, are covered by different rules.
The changes come months before a US presidential election in November that tech researchers warn may be transformed by generative AI technologies. Political campaigns have already begun deploying AI tools in places like Indonesia, pushing the boundaries of guidelines issued by providers like Meta and generative AI market leader OpenAI.
In February, Meta’s oversight board called the company’s existing rules on manipulated media “incoherent” after reviewing a video of Joe Biden posted on Facebook last year that altered real footage to wrongfully suggest the US president had behaved inappropriately.
The footage was permitted to stay up, as Meta’s existing “manipulated media” policy bars misleadingly altered videos only if they were produced by artificial intelligence or if they make people appear to say words they never actually said.
The board said the policy should also apply to non-AI content, which is “not necessarily any less misleading” than content generated by AI, as well as to audio-only content and videos depicting people doing things they never actually said or did.Publication by mayor’s office of environmental justice is first comprehensive survey of environmental inequalities
Nearly half of all New Yorkers live in areas with “disproportionate” burdens from pollution, a city report has found. Most affected are communities of color, which are also more vulnerable to impacts from climate change, according to a citywide assessment released on Friday.
“We’ve had the orange sky last year, we’re going to have more recurrent extreme weather events that are going to impact the most vulnerable in our communities,” said Elizabeth Yeampierre, executive director of UpRose, an environmental justice group based in Brooklyn.
The report, published by the mayor’s office of environmental justice, is the city’s first comprehensive survey of environmental inequalities.
It noted that Black New Yorkers are twice as likely to die from heat stress as white New Yorkers and found that the predominantly Black and Hispanic neighborhoods of Harlem and the South Bronx are among the most affected by high-heat days, with the latter registering temperatures 8F (4.5C) hotter than the wealthier and tree-covered areas of the Upper West Side and the Upper East Side. Areas most vulnerable to stormwater flooding include majority Black and Hispanic communities in south-east and central Queens, as well as the south-east Bronx.
Researchers attributed many of the disparities to racially discriminatory real estate practices, or redlining. Around two-thirds of people who live in historically redlined areas – a population that is disproportionately Black and Hispanic or Latino – live in zones the city identifies as environmental justice (EJ) areas. These areas were identified based on the state’s disadvantaged communities (DAC) criteria, which uses race and income data.
“Understanding what was placed in communities over time, and how do we rectify those injustices, that’s what we’re trying to identify with this [report]”, said Costa Constantinides, a member of the environmental justice advisory board involved in the report and a former city councilmember from Queens.
The assessment found that highways, industrial power plants and waste-processing facilities are disproportionately concentrated near communities of color. As of 2021, 13 of the city’s 19 gas-powered “peaker” plant facilities were located in an EJ area, including the South Bronx, Astoria, Queens and Sunset Park, Brooklyn.
Meanwhile, EJ communities are less likely to access parks and a quarter of New Yorkers living in poverty struggle to afford public transit fares.
“It [the report] ensures that environmental justice is on the city’s agenda,” said Peggy Shepard, executive director of We Act for Environmental Justice and who was involved in the report. “The next stage is developing a comprehensive, city-wide plan to address the environmental justice issues identified in the report, and engaging with those most impacted to develop effective and equitable solutions.”Jamie Lloyd Company says abuse came after cast list made public for show with Tom Holland and Francesca Amewudah-Rivers
A theatre company has condemned the “barrage of deplorable racial abuse” that has been directed at a cast member of a new production of Romeo & Juliet.
In a statement on Friday, the Jamie Lloyd Company said the online abuse “must stop” and that further harassment would be reported. It came after the announcement of the full cast of the show, including Tom Holland and Francesca Amewudah-Rivers as Romeo and Juliet, alongside Freema Agyeman, Michael Balogun, Tomiwa Edun, Mia Jerome, Daniel Quinn-Toye and Ray Sesay.
“Following the announcement of our Romeo & Juliet cast, there has been a barrage of deplorable racial abuse online directed towards a member of our company,” the statement said. “This must stop. We are working with a remarkable group of artists. We insist that they are free to create work without facing online harassment.”
The company, run by the director Jamie Lloyd, said it would “continue to support and protect everyone in our company at all costs. Any abuse will not be tolerated and will be reported. Bullying and harassment have no place online, in our industry or in our wider communities.”
Its rehearsal room for the show was “full of joy, compassion and kindness,” the company said.
It added: “We celebrate the extraordinary talent of our incredible collaborators. The Romeo & Juliet community will continue to rehearse with generosity and love, and focus on the creation of our production.”
The play runs at the Duke of York’s Theatre from 11 May – 3 August. It will be the Spider-Man star Holland’s first major theatre role since his debut in Billy Elliot: The Musical.
Last summer, he said he was taking a break from acting after starring in the Apple TV+ series The Crowded Room, a psychological thriller that he also produced. The star has become one of Britain’s best-known young screen actors but owes his career to the stage.
Lloyd is known for mounting bold, megastar-led versions of classic plays such as Doctor Faustus with Kit Harington, Betrayal with Tom Hiddleston and The Seagull with Emilia Clarke. His new production of the musical Sunset Boulevard, with Nicole Scherzinger, recently ended a sold-out run at London’s Savoy theatre and is transferring to Broadway in September.
Last year Lloyd directed Taylor Russell and Paapa Essiedu in a revival of Lucy Prebble’s play The Effect at the National Theatre, before opening at the Shed in New York last month.
Romeo & Juliet is billed as “a pulsating new vision of Shakespeare’s immortal tale of wordsmiths, rhymers, lovers and fighters”. It is Lloyd’s first Shakespeare production since he staged Richard III at Trafalgar Studios in 2014, with Martin Freeman in the lead role.They’ve torn up the rulebook, left no taboo unbroken and freestyled one of the greatest comedies ever. As the finale airs, the Curb team reveal all about success, Springsteen – and Larry David’s soft side
For 25 years, Larry David has boldly, repeatedly gone where no one else would dare. His fictionalised alter ego has besmirched the honour of an unsuccessful kamikaze pilot who survived the second world war until the man’s son tried to kill himself (“He grazed the ship!?! … Did he say: ‘Jesus, this kamikaze business might not be for me?’”). He has hosted a dinner party featuring a contestant on the reality show Survivor having an explosive row about hardship with an actual Holocaust survivor (Survivor contestant: “I couldn’t even work out!”). At one point, despite his social circle’s protests, he even ended up befriending a sex offender. It has been outrageously funny, so toe-curlingly awkward that it’s borderline painful, but never less than utterly unique, spellbindingly watchable TV.
And this weekend, it comes to an end. After a quarter of a century spent portraying the most amusing curmudgeon in TV history, David is ready to retire Larry once and for all with Curb Your Enthusiasm’s finale. It comes off the back of one of the show’s funniest seasons ever – in which David has variously tried to buy a racist statue off a Black employee after accidentally breaking someone else’s ornament (“I just have to replace it!” “So you already have one?”). Or knocked Academy Award-winning actor Troy Kotsur clean off his feet by driving a golf ball into his back, then flashed his testicles to escape the consequences. Will we see Larry doing jail time in the finale for having unwittingly violated a law about bringing water to voters waiting in line? We’ll have to wait and see – but it’s sure to be funny.
Back in 1999, it was a very different show. Curb launched with an hour-long special that David and director Robert B Weide approached as a microbudget indie, shot with cheap handheld videocameras and verité lighting.
“It was very rough around the edges, and that was fine, because that’s sort of the look we were going for,” Weide says of a show that saw Larry making up an illness for a nonexistent stepfather to get out of a standup special. “Everything was really on the fly. Nothing was planned until we got to location. We were totally figuring it out as we went.”
It was David’s attempt to pursue a new challenge after excusing himself from Seinfeld’s writing team. His plan: push the little absurdities of everyday etiquette until they explode into conflict. It’s meant that throughout the show’s 12 seasons, rather than scripting scenes himself, David preferred to gather capable improvisers, give them certain prompts for the content of a scene, and let the natural rhythms of conversation play themselves out. Many of the most quotable one-liners arose spontaneously within the moment.
“In the beginning, I had to get up to speed just to hop onboard!” recalls JB Smoove, a regular scene-stealer as Larry’s mooching houseguest turned roommate Leon. “Luckily for me, I had a background in improv and had worked in the fast-paced environment of Saturday Night Live. The show has a process, unique to itself. You are doing real-time, in-your-head writing. Curb presented the ultimate improv challenge to everyone who ever appeared on it.”
It also firmly eschewed sitcom staples such as characters undergoing growth or falling in love – opting instead for pure laughs. Indeed, the upcoming series finale is fittingly called No Lessons Learned. Throughout its duration, Curb has delighted in exploring our unspoken rules of etiquette: Is it better to toss or pass your keys to a valet? Exactly how many members of a restaurant’s staff should you tip? His love of the free liquorice given away at a car dealership forces him to spend $150,000 on a sports car he does not want. A dispute at a coffee shop leads to a season-long arc that sees Larry open his own rival “spite store” right next door. “It’s one of the few pure comedies on TV right now,” says Weide. “A viewer desires nothing more than to watch people they’re interested in doing funny things.”
One of the greatest strengths of the show is David’s outrageous version of himself. On Seinfeld, David had always used the character of George as a stand-in for himself, and didn’t want to repeat the trick. So rather than a hapless doofus, David made the fictionalised Larry a calamity-prone industry insider moving through a moneyed Orange County of laundromats, golf courses and doctors’ offices – and he is less similar to the real David than you might think.
“TV Larry has a pile of shit that he has to deal with and so does Real Larry, it’s just different shit!” says Smoove. “The Larry he plays on the show is very outspoken and obnoxious. The real Larry is much more reserved, but interesting as hell. Larry is a knowledgable history buff, and an incredible storyteller with a lot of great damn stories.”
The show’s creators soon realised that any taboo – racism, the Holocaust, incest, bestiality – could be safely teased so long as Larry ended up the butt of the joke. One of the true masterworks of 21st-century comedy, the episode Palestinian Chicken turned the conflict in Gaza into an LA turf war, with the sincerely indifferent Larry caught between his favourite lunch spot and peer pressure from his fellow Jews. Whether inadvertently teaching a gay child to sew a swastika or taking Michael J Fox’s Parkinson’s side-effects as a personal slight, he mined humour from his own small-mindedness and insensitivity – a willingness to laugh at himself that has proved essential to the show’s longevity.
It was also a draw for guest stars. Some dropped by to play cracked-mirror parodies of themselves. Salman Rushdie discussed all the tail he got after the Ayatollah called for a fatwa against him. Ricky Gervais passed through to pitilessly mock the “broad” laugh-tracking on Seinfeld. Other comedy stars blended right into the fabric of Curb, such as Bill Hader as three nearly identical Hungarians who insist they don’t know one another, or Fred Armisen as a disabled man blocking Larry’s way in a narrow corridor. When they needed actors to welcome Larry to paradise during a near-death experience, they got Sacha Baron Cohen and Dustin Hoffman. Inevitably, they found Larry so annoying that they threw him out of heaven.
“Everyone’s welcoming, and they’re a well-established, comfortable group,” says Tracey Ullman – who plays Irma Kostroski, a repellent councilwoman with a “strong sexual musk” that Larry woos to get out of a jam involving a local ordinance requiring fences around one’s pool, then can’t get rid of. “It was such a joy to be part of it. This is the end of a wonderful era.”
With none other than Bruce Springsteen dropping in for last week’s penultimate episode (only for Larry to give him Covid), the impressive lineup of visiting talent testifies to Curb’s stature in the TV history books. “His popularity in England makes this show one of the few comedies to earn that respect across the pond,” Ullman says. “Larry’s really been embraced.”
Improbably, the real David has begun to intrude upon mainstream culture. He inspired a weeklong viral news cycle for strangling the life out of Sesame Street’s Elmo on daytime television (David’s explanation: “He was going on about mental health and I had to listen to every word. I was going, ‘Oh, my God, I don’t think I can take another second of this!’ So I got off my chair, I approached him, and I throttled him!”). He’s been snapped by the paparazzi while lunching with Timothée Chalamet, and shouted out by such rappers as Tyler the Creator, Travis Scott and Drake. Most improbably of all, he’s emerged as a normcore fashion icon, his daily uniform of cotton tees, well-fitted blazers and unostentatious sneakers landing him a laudatory writeup in GQ (“Is there a more recognizable, self-assured, incredibly specific wardrobe to be found anywhere in pop culture?” it asked). As David brings Curb Your Enthusiasm to a grand conclusion, even diehard fans may wonder how this cantankerous bundle of neuroses has become an icon of his time.
“When he was starting, I thought he was brilliant,” Weide says of David’s early days – when he ground against a business that found him loud and annoying. “Audiences didn’t know what to make of his work back then, though. I remember thinking, ‘Boy, if the country ever catches up to this guy’s sense of humour, we’ll have riots in the streets.’ Later on, they’d sometimes ask if he could do anything to make Larry more likable, and he’d always go, ‘Ehhhhh, no.’”
He understood what every Curb viewer has come to understand: we cannot detest Larry any more than we detest the most embarrassing, flawed human parts of ourselves. David has often described the Larry character as his version of Superman, a hero who can do the things basic decency forbids him from doing in his own life – even if that’s just calling out queue-jumping and other minor social infractions.
“Larry’s secretly a lovely man,” Ullman says. “A show can’t go on this long without someone great at the top.” David’s is the comedy of admission – yes, other people’s children are insufferable, yes, Hamilton was overrated, yes, that guy over there is hogging the canapes. He serves our species’ essential need to gripe, providing a vital outlet for all the pent-up irritation that holds civilisation together by going unsaid. Like God, if Larry David did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him. As Weide sees it, Larry will attain eternal life in the hearts and minds of anybody who’s ever felt like yelling at someone for walking too slowly. “It’s just a silly show, and now it’s sort of in our DNA.”

Season one, episode eightThe moment when Curb Your Enthusiasm first fully found its voice. Larry is tasked with writing an obituary for his wife’s aunt, which accidentally results in the filthiest misprint imaginable (you can probably work it out).
Season seven, episode sixCurb has always delighted in nudging the boundaries of acceptability. Nowhere was that more evident than this, the episode where Larry accidentally urinates on a picture of christ. People subsequently mistake the urine for tears, and a bout of religious hysteria ensues.
Season seven, episode nineThe Seinfeld finale is one of the most divisive in history, so Larry David spent an entire season of Curb Your Enthusiasm trying to fix it. A Seinfeld reunion in all but name, the highlight of which was a Bob Einstein joke about a woman who packs her vagina with offal.
Season eight, episode threeOne of Larry David’s favourite episodes, in which Larry is caught in the middle of two opposing sides. On one side: all of his Jewish friends. On the other: an antisemitic Palestinian woman who might want to have sex with him.
Season nine, episode 10Curb’s ninth season revolves around Larry’s attempt to stage a musical based on the fatwa issued against Salman Rushdie in the 1980s. The season finale opens with a number – performed by Lin-Manuel Miranda (as Rushdie) and F Murray Abraham (as the Ayatollah Khomeini) – that is so good you wish the musical existed for real.
Curb Your Enthusiasm’s finale episode airs in the UK on Sky Comedy on Mon 8th April.Over 150 Jewish Hollywood professionals express support for director after he faced backlash for speech
More than 150 Jewish Hollywood professionals, including Joaquin Phoenix, Joel Coen and Ilana Glazer, have expressed their support for Jonathan Glazer after the Zone of Interest director faced intense backlash for his acceptance speech at this year’s Oscars.
In an open letter published on Friday, the signatories wrote they were “alarmed to see some of our colleagues in the industry mischaracterize and denounce his remarks”.
“Their attacks on Glazer are a dangerous distraction from Israel’s escalating military campaign which has already killed over 32,000 Palestinians in Gaza and brought hundreds of thousands to the brink of starvation,” the letter reads. “We grieve for all those who have been killed in Palestine and Israel over too many decades, including the 1,200 Israelis killed in the October 7th Hamas attacks and the 253 hostages taken.”
The controversy over Glazer’s speech, in which he said he refuted his “Jewishness and the Holocaust being hijacked by an occupation which has led to conflict for so many innocent people” in Gaza and Israel, has persisted for weeks.
After the Academy Awards, the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) condemned his remarks and hundreds of Jewish Hollywood figures signed an open letter accusing Glazer of “drawing a moral equivalence between a Nazi regime that sought to exterminate a race of people, and an Israeli nation that seeks to avert its own extermination”.
But other filmmakers and organizations praised Glazer and said his words resonated with them, highlighting the complexity of views on the Israel-Gaza war and the rift it has created within the Jewish community.
“In his Oscar acceptance speech, Jonathan Glazer issued a universal moral warning against dehumanization. His aim was not to descend to the level of political discourse,” Piotr Cywiński, the director of the Auschwitz Memorial, said in a statement. “Critics who expected a clear political stance or a film solely about genocide did not grasp the depth of his message.
Ken Loach, the veteran British film director, this week spoke out in support of Glazer, calling his speech “very brave”.
“And I’m sure he understood the possible consequences, which makes him braver still, so I’ve got great respect for him and his work,” he said in an interview with Variety.
The authors of this week’s letter wrote they were concerned about the “silencing effect” the attacks on Glazer could have.
“Glazer, Tony Kushner, Steven Spielberg and countless other artists of all backgrounds have decried the killing of Palestinian civilians. We should all be able to do the same without being wrongly accused of fueling anti-semitism,” the letter reads.
They also called for a permanent ceasefire, the safe return of hostages and the immediate delivery of aid to Gaza.
“We are proud Jews who denounce the weaponization of Jewish identity and the memory of the Holocaust to justify what many experts in international law, including leading Holocaust scholars, have identified as a ‘genocide in the making’. We reject the false choice between Jewish safety and Palestinian freedom.”
The signatories include Boots Riley, Abbi Jacobson, Frances Fisher, Annie Baker, Naomi Klein, V, Alexander Zeldin, Rain Phoenix, Chloe Fineman, David Cross, Tavi Gevinson and Kate Berlant, among others.Locations in London, New York, Barcelona and Madrid to be shut ‘after long and careful consideration’
The Marlborough Gallery is to close in June, shutting locations in London, New York, Barcelona and Madrid and bringing to an end one of the most influential “blue chip” galleries in the world.
The decision to close after almost 80 years came “after long and careful consideration”, according to the board of trustees at the gallery, which was once on the bleeding edge of the global art market but in recent years had failed to keep up with the evolution of the sector and was riven by internal power struggles.
On Thursday, the board member Franz Plutschow announced the decision to “sunset” the business, which had once had Francis Bacon, Frank Auerbach, Henry Moore, Lucian Freud, Barbara Hepworth and Paula Rego on its books.
The Marlborough was opened in 1946 by Frank Lloyd and Harry Fischer, who were later joined by David Somerset and Lloyd’s son Gilbert. For the first two decades of its life the gallery established a reputation for incredibly shrewd deals and timely, agenda-setting shows.
In the 1950s, well-received exhibitions of Juan Gris positioned the Marlborough as an exciting new space in London, while its relationship with Francis Bacon and its decision to open an outpost in New York in 1963 made it one of the first “mega galleries”.
The Guardian described Lloyd and Fischer as “two partners [who] supply the eyes and ears of the business at home”, while Lord Somerset was called “a sort of  éminence grise continually roving the continent”.
It was on one of those tours that the gallery secured the kind of “astounding” deal it was initially known for. In 1960, the Marlborough bought part of the collection of the Norwegian shipping magnate Ragnar Moltzau, before selling on the pieces – including Cézanne’s Quarry at Bibémus – for huge profit.
But by the 1970s the gallery’s reputation began to suffer after a scandal involving Mark Rothko’s estate, which had sold paintings to the gallery for under market value; leading to a legal case and Lloyd being found to have tampered with evidence.
More recently there had been a protracted power struggle at the top of the organisation after Gilbert Lloyd allegedly pushed out Lloyd’s nephew Pierre Levai, who had served as chair.
That led to a lawsuit brought by Levai’s son Max that eventually revealed the gallery, which owns an estimated 15,000 works that are thought to be valued at about $250m, reportedly lost $18.7m between 2013 and 2019.
A spokesperson for the gallery told the Art Newspaper that the family issues “were resolved” and had “nothing to do with this decision to wind down the business”.
In 2022, three directors left and were followed by Rego who departed for the Victoria Miro gallery in the same year. In the last few years the gallery’s turnover dropped sharply, although it or its parent company reportedly still owns the properties in London, New York, and Madrid, plus warehouses in Spain and New York which it plans to sell.The physical efforts of Jia Ling, who writes, directs and stars, are impressive, but too much time is spent labouring over well-worn tropes of the genre
Jia Ling writes, directs and stars in this boxing drama with a twist: there’s not really very much boxing in it. In this smash hit from China, we’re introduced to Du Leying (Jia) as a no-hoper; the perspective, in fact, of the supporting characters and the film itself is that it would be hard to imagine a bigger loser. She’s 32, lives at home, doesn’t adhere to traditional beauty norms (particularly as regards body weight), and her boyfriend is cheating on her with her best friend. When this affair is discovered, the best friend heaps another item on the laundry list of putative indignities that make up Leying’s life by immediately asking her to be a maid of honour at the wedding.
But as far as we can tell, she has been living her life as if she has been recently dumped for a really long time anyway, and the film takes its sweet time showing us the catalytic change we know is coming. At around the 45-minute mark, she goes to the gym for the first time. You could probably compress everything that happens in that first 45 minutes into 10 without losing any crucial narrative or cutting any of the occasional, limp jokes. Once she gets to the gym, the point is further belaboured: she is surrounded by slender lissome young lovelies flirting with their enthusiastic personal trainers, whereas she is – surprise, surprise – less popular.
About an hour into the film, she goes to a supermarket and puts some healthy food in a shopping trolley. A little later, she punches a sleazy colleague in the face. There is still, somehow at this point, almost half an hour before the montage we know is coming, of Leying seriously training and losing weight and getting into boxing. There is something striking about seeing the real-life actor lose 50kg (7st 12lb) across the course of the montage but, as with all such sequences, it won’t be for everyone. One person’s inspirational personal journey of extreme transformation is another person’s triggering affirmation of diet culture in a society where it’s hard to escape the message that thin is king. As a document of a physical transformation, the film delivers. As a comedy or romance, not so much.

Have you listened to Cowboy Carter yet? No, but I mean all of it? All 27 tracks? All 78 minutes and 21 seconds? Don’t be ashamed if you haven’t. Beyoncé’s sprawling paean to country music is a formidable piece of work, created by a boatload’s worth of talent (seriously, check out how long those album credits are), full of luscious layered textures and inventive production, and dabbling in everything from acoustic, finger-picked folk to zydeco. It’s probably not one to gobble up in a single sitting.
Beyoncé’s hardly an outlier in this regard – Drake’s albums regularly nudge past the 80-minute mark, and Morgan Wallen’s 2023 chart topper One Thing at a Time was a preposterous 111 minutes long. And excess is hardly specific to music. So much of popular culture tends towards the lengthy these days, from films (including the current Oscar best picture winner) that require at least one mid-screening loo break to get through, to TV episodes that regularly nudge past the hour mark (or two hours in the case of Stranger Things), to podcast episodes that take multiple commutes to get through.
These long runtimes tend to attract a fair bit of annoyance, particularly when it comes to films, where 90 minutes has long been considered the platonic ideal. (I remember one year at the Cannes film festival, critics seemed more excited to see Joaquin Phoenix thriller You Were Never Really Here than any of the other films in competition, primarily because it was 1hr 35m in a sea of backside-numbingly long dramas.)
There isn’t anything particularly wrong with art running long. In fact in a sense it might be considered heartening, a sign of creative freedom still being allowed to flourish at a time when so much culture seems algorithmically micro-tooled. It’s even slightly flattering to us consumers – so often told that we have the attention span of a toddler – to be given something substantial to chew on.
Still, it is good to have something to provide a bit of contrast, and there are plenty of people creating small but satisfying culture at the moment. Just arrived on BBC iPlayer is series three of Diane Morgan’s gonzo sitcom Mandy, which trims the comedy down to 15 minutes but packs plenty in – the new series features, among other things, a plane hijacking and a spot of paranormal activity. And my favourite movie of recent months is the Oscar nominee for best animated film Robot Dreams, which managed to tell an epic story of loss and loneliness in 80s New York in just over that desired 90 minute benchmark.
But it’s music that seems to have the biggest contrast between long and short releases. One of 2023’s most celebrated albums, Guts by Olivia Rodrigo, clocked in at half the length of Cowboy Carter, but was no less impressive for its brevity. At 39 minutes and 12 tracks, Guts is really what used to be considered a fairly usual length for an album – about the same length as Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, for example – but is almost a novelty in an age of track creep. And Guts is still longer than Tierra Whack’s outsider-rap opus World Wide Whack, a svelte 37 minutes despite being 15 tracks long (mind you, Whack’s debut mixtape had that many tracks and was just 15 minutes long).
But we can go even shorter: two of my favourite albums of 2023, Dead Meat by the Tubs and Life Under the Gun by Militarie Gun, clock in at under 25 minutes. And 25 minutes almost looks decadent compared to the brevity of some hardcore and punk albums – This Is All We Ever Get, the new album by hardcore band SPACED from Buffalo, New York gets in and out in just 15 minutes. The king of short albums though must be Tony Molina, who has made a career out of creating miniaturised albums, each tackling a different sound – fuzzed out pop-punk, gentle folk-country, hair metal – sometimes in as little as 10 minutes.
In fact, add together the lengths all of the six albums Molina has released to date and you’ll get a total listening time of 82 minutes and 11 seconds … in other words, just a shade over the length of, yep, Cowboy Carter.

Before last summer’s Edinburgh international book festival (EIBF) had even begun, it was already the subject of a high-profile boycott and petition.
In July, Scottish investigative news site the Ferret calculated that the festival’s lead sponsor, investment management firm Baillie Gifford, had up to £5bn invested in companies profiting from fossil fuels. Days later, Greta Thunberg pulled out from her scheduled talk, accusing Baillie Gifford of greenwashing. Soon, more than 50 authors and event chairs including Zadie Smith, Ali Smith and Katherine Rundell had signed a letter calling on the company to stop investing in fossil fuel-linked businesses. If that demand wasn’t met, the group said that Edinburgh should find a new sponsor – and if it didn’t, authors should boycott the 2024 festival.
Organisers are now gearing up for the August festival, and new director Jenny Niven says she sees this year as something of a “relaunch”. The founder of Edinburgh’s poetry and spoken word festival Push the Boat Out has taken over from Nick Barley, who ran EIBF for 14 years. Niven’s “relaunch” will see the festival move to a new venue: the Edinburgh Futures Institute, part of the University of Edinburgh located in the restored Royal Infirmary. The controversial sponsorship arrangement remains in place, however: Baillie Gifford will still be a “major part” of the festival, the new director confirms.
Though Niven took over the director role in September last year, her appointment had been announced in June, before the sponsorship argument kicked off. “I’ve been spending some of the time doing things that I didn’t expect to be doing,” she says of the controversy. “But that’s just the nature of the beast.”
The event will “continue to rely on a mix of public, and corporate, and philanthropic funding, and we’ll be very grateful for that”, says Niven. She and the other organisers believe that “all parts of society should be contributing [to] and valuing the arts, because of the role that arts and culture play in health and wellbeing, in education, in social cohesion.” One initiative Baillie Gifford has sponsored for “many years”, says Niven, is providing free tickets, transport and books to children attending the festival on school trips.
Niven says that “we need to be really careful what we wish for” regarding sponsorship. There have been cases “where funding has disappeared and projects have just stopped”, she points out, drawing attention to Glasgow’s Aye Write festival, which was cancelled this year after its funding application was rejected by public funding body Creative Scotland. “We are not the only festival, nor the only arts and cultural organisation that is supported in this way,” she adds. Baillie Gifford sponsors a number of other literary festivals including Hay, Cheltenham and Cambridge, as well as the Baillie Gifford prize, the most prestigious nonfiction writing prize in the UK.
At last year’s EIBF, activist and author Mikaela Loach staged a protest against Baillie Gifford’s investments, and following the festival the campaign group Fossil Free Books (FFB) was formed. In October last year more than 150 authors and book industry professionals signed a statement by FFB calling on Baillie Gifford to divest from fossil fuels.
The theme of this year’s EIBF is “future tense”, because society is “grappling with so many big systemic challenges” across politics, economics and climate, says Niven.
Author Yara Rodrigues Fowler, one of FFB’s core organisers, says she thinks “the ‘relaunch’ and new ‘future’ theme are just optics.”
“The festival hasn’t addressed the concerns raised by hundreds of authors last year, and, at the end of the day, the climate crisis isn’t being caused by plastic cups at literary festivals, it’s being caused by fossil fuel companies”, she adds. “Baillie Gifford has decided to sponsor literary festivals for a reason; I urge Baillie Gifford, and their clients, to listen to the concerns of authors and divest.”
Asked about last year’s backlash, Niven says that a “plurality of voices” is “absolutely essential” in moving towards a just transition. “If you don’t want writers to speak their minds, then you probably shouldn’t be running a book festival,” she adds. Last year’s debate encouraged people to “think with a bit more nuance” about divestment, meaning there is now a “greater understanding of these issues” within the literary community, says Niven. Yet she expects similar pushback this year, because “those issues are not solved and they’re not going away”. At the 2024 festival there will be “space for welcome disagreement”.
A spokesperson from FFB has told the Guardian that it recommends that authors decline invitations to festivals sponsored by Baillie Gifford, or use appearances to call on the company to divest from the fossil fuel industry. It is now working to arrange support for authors who decline festival invitations. “These festivals are our livelihoods and we care about them deeply,” the representative says. “We don’t want to shut these festivals down, nor can we afford to.”

FFB believes that divestment by Baillie Gifford “should be achievable” because the investments make up a “small percentage” of the investment management firm’s portfolio, the spokesperson adds. According to Baillie Gifford, just 2% of its clients’ money is invested in companies with more than 5% of their revenue coming from some form of fossil fuel activities, compared with the market average of 11%.
The spokesperson also drew attention to a December report that named Baillie Gifford as an investor in businesses that are linked to Israeli settlements in the West Bank. The campaign group also calls on Baillie Gifford to divest from these companies.
Niven says that last year’s controversy has “not made a major impact” on getting authors on board for 2024. When authors have raised the sponsorship issue, organisers have engaged in “robust” conversation with them. “We’re also remaining in dialogue with people who signed the letter, we’re continuing to talk to Baillie Gifford”.
A spokesperson from Baillie Gifford says that the company is “committed to thoughtfully analysing all the businesses we invest in and believe they must act responsibly and legally. We take this duty seriously and, like other firms in our industry, are guided by international sanctions.”
Niven says she sees it as a “a privilege” to take the festival “into the next chapter”.” The festival is “ready for a good shake-up”, she adds, “and I feel really confident that I’m the person to do it”.From eye masks to flannels, AirTags to paddling pools, our travel, fashion and beauty experts share their hard-won hacks, gadgets and tips

Who doesn’t want some French saucisson or real hot sauce from Mexico?Fiona Kerr, travel writer
I always take a Nalgene water bottle, which can double up as a hot water bottle when camping (even in summer in the UK it can get cold at night). Fill it with boiling water and put it in your sleeping bag before you get in, so it’s nice and cosy. It will keep you warm all night. Jane Dunford, deputy travel editor
One key learning from holidaying with teenagers is that the middle-of-nowhere isolation that feels blissful to middle-aged parents is essentially torture to teenagers. Teenagers are addicted to other teenagers. This doesn’t mean you have to take your family hols in Faliraki, but it does mean it’s worth thinking about a location where the kids can walk to a local beach or village by themselves when they fancy a break from the olds. A little bit of freedom goes a long way to keeping teenage spirits up. Jess Cartner-Morley, associate editor (fashion)
My sleeper train essentials include an eye mask, ear plugs, bed socks, towelling slippers (you can swipe these from hotels) or flip-flops for trips to the loo, and a small bottle of hand soap. Always carry cash in case the wifi is down and card payments aren’t working, and don’t wear anything loose or swishy that will wipe the floor around you – leggings or yoga-style pants are ideal. Before you sleep, make sure to rattle-proof the compartment: take down coat hangers and lay bottles flat. And finally, if you even wonder for a moment if you need the loo ... go! You won’t sleep until you do. Monisha Rajesh, author and journalist
It is an immutable law of adventurous travel that all bags will be filled to bursting and your shoes will fall apart. That’s certainly true for my kind of far-flung trips, but even on a weekend away in Barcelona a wheel can detach from the wheelie bag at the worst possible moment. So now I take one sturdy rucksack that falls within budget airline restrictions and wear the sturdiest of hiking boots. It might raise eyebrows when you check in at a chateau or country house hotel, but you will swan past the baggage carousel and still be able to yomp into town during the taxi strike. The hard-shell wheelie bag I once bought remains in the attic, awaiting spare parts. Kevin Rushby, travel writer
You only need two lipsticks/glosses/balms. One nude and something bolder, like red, will work for any occasion. The best way to cleanse is with a warm flannel, but not all holiday accommodation provides them, so I take a few flannels with me, plus a waterproof pouch to bring them home in. No one wears enough SPF. Best practice is at least two finger-lengths (index and middle finger) for face and neck. Take a dedicated facial SPF rather than just SPF makeup – you’d have to cake yourself in it to be safe (by all means take it, but adopt a belt-and-braces approach by putting it on top of your sun protection). And pack an SPF mist so you can top up without removing your makeup. Sali Hughes, beauty columnist
I’ve taken some of the stress out of travelling by using an Apple AirTag, which I leave in my checked luggage. It makes the wait at the baggage carousel less stressful, as I’ll know by then if the luggage has got lost along the way. They’re useful things to have – keep one in your handbag, rucksack or hire car. I just wish I’d also left one in our own car, which was stolen recently while I was away. Mary Novakovich, travel writer
If you have babies or toddlers, you may already own a small inflatable paddling pool. Take it on your beach holiday. It may sound crazy when you have the actual sea to play in, but hear me out. Babies love to crawl away, and eat sand, and go dangerously near the waves. Plonk them in a paddling pool with some toys and they’re safe and happy. You might even get to read your book for five minutes.  Suzanne Lemon, art director
Recently, in The Passenger Press, a wonderful shop in Glasgow, I discovered Papier d’Arménie, scented papers that you can set alight to remove unfortunate odours. They are tiny and can be carried in a purse or wallet, have 36 strips and come in three scents. Audrey Gillan, journalist and broadcaster
Going for a swim is a brilliant way to calm frazzled senses when you’re on the road, particularly when travelling with children. It really helps them to unravel after being cramped up and bombarded with new noises, sights and smells. I recently had a few hours’ stopover in Paris after an overnight bus and, instead of racing around the sights, I found a cheap local hammam for a soak in a hot pool and a steam. I felt much more human when I got home than if I’d spent the morning walking up the Champs-Élysées. Rhiannon Batten, travel writer
Pack a travel cosmetics kit for your beauty and health items, then pop it on a hook in your hotel bathroom. The best one I have found is Bagsmart’s Space Saver toiletry bag – it isn’t bulky, unlike lots of travel beauty cases, and it’s wipe-clean. Holidays are a good chance to try something new and break beauty habits. So if you feel like you “need” makeup every day when you’re at home, try easing up on it when you’re on holiday, to feel more comfortable in your own skin. Conversely, if you find wearing makeup daunting, try experimenting with it on holiday, when you’re more relaxed and care less about the judgment of strangers. Anita Bhagwandas, beauty columnist

Make a playlist as you go. Ask people you meet for recommendations; listen out for the music playing around you in cafes, bars and hotel dining rooms; search for local bands. You’ll end up with a musical memory of the trip – an eclectic selection that will whisk you back there whenever you play it. It’s an especially good thing for solo travellers to do – asking for suggestions is a great conversation starter. Sarah Louise Baxter, travel writer
When you’re about to head to a country where you don’t speak the language, rather than simply memorising the usual “Hello. Goodbye. Excuse me. Sorry. Thank you”, try to learn 100 nouns (or 200-300 if you’ve the time). It may sound daunting, but with apps and phrase books it takes less time than you’d think. Even if I’m heading for a country where the locals speak great English, I find it really helpful when reading signs, menus etc. Dixe Wills, travel writer
Try the 3-3-3 packing method. Essentially, it means choosing three tops, three bottoms and three pairs of shoes to create multiple looks. You can tweak it according to the type of holiday and your own style. TikTok has loads of videos with suggestions of what to take on various trips, and you’d be surprised how many looks you can make out of nine core pieces. Get a long strap for your phone. That way, you can wear it crossbody and avoid stressing about it getting snatched out of your hand when taking photos in tourist/pickpocket hotspots. For mooching around a gallery or day trips, think about whether you really need a bag. Instead of carrying a wallet, I use Apple Pay and download e-tickets. If you need a physical cards try a magnetic wallet that attaches to the back of your phone. You can fit cash in the back of it too. If you’re dining at your hotel, ask for dessert to be brought to your room, so you can pop on a comfy robe and eat it in bed while watching Netflix. Chloe Mac Donnell, deputy fashion editor
Packing blister plasters may sound OTT but there is nothing worse than developing a blister on day one of a minibreak when day two is going to require a high step count. So Compeed yourself in advance – you know the problem spots; there is probably still an echo of a blister from the last time you explored a new city – and avoid developing a bigger problem when you’re just hitting your stride. Ellie Bramley, acting fashion editor
You never know what types of tea will be available when you arrive at self-catering accommodation: I pack a handful of my favourite teabags (breakfast, decaf, peppermint). If it’s a fairly local destination, I’ll also take an insulated bottle with some cold milk in, so we can have a cuppa when we arrive, and unpack before worrying about where to do the big shop (or waiting for it to be delivered, if we’ve managed to be so organised). Ruth Lewy, deputy editor
I was very much mum-fluenced into buying a set of transparent zip pouches, but they really are useful, essentially turning your backpack into a portable filing cabinet. I have a separate pouch for snacks, one for spare clothes, another for child-friendly activities (AKA iPads). And as long as you leave everything pouched up once you reach your destination (and I pack spares so I can create the likes of a “swimming things” pouch), they also speed up the inexplicably laborious task of getting a family out of the door for various activities. Just shove the relevant pouches in the bag and go! Abigail Radnor, lifestyle editorRaj doesn’t think bedding needs to be changed more than once a month, but Mandeep is a lover of freshly laundered sheets. Whose argument doesn’t wash?Find out how to get a disagreement settled or become a juror
Raj would happily sleep in the same sheets for a whole month, which I think is disgusting
I stand firm in my belief that clean bedsheets are the key to a good night’s sleep, but Raj, my boyfriend of two years, couldn’t care less.
A weekly bedsheet change makes me feel good. Slipping into freshly laundered sheets is a small but significant act of self-care – a ritual that sets the tone for your whole night and the next day. But Raj thinks that is over the top and would happily sleep in the same sheets for a month, which I think is disgusting.
I’ll tell Raj that he needs to change the sheets when I’m away, or when I can’t do it, and he just ignores me. When I protest he just says, “It’s clean enough.” As a result, I end up doing the lion’s share of the laundry. Washing and changing the sheets each week is time-consuming, but I do it because I can’t get into a bed unless it’s clean, pressed and fresh. In Raj’s eyes, my insistence on weekly sheet changes is excessive and impractical. He says that because we both shower daily, our sheets aren’t that dirty and that he can’t feel much of a difference.
I disagree – it’s not just about what we can feel, but the actual dirt. Our skin sheds dead cells and oils throughout the night, creating a breeding ground for bacteria. Dirty sheets also lead to clogged pores, acne and irritation. At 28, I’m prone to breakouts, but when I started changing my sheets more often a few years ago, I noticed an improvement in my acne.
I’m really into posh linen: my favourite is a cool blue Tencel set, which is made from natural eucalyptus fibres and cost about £100; and I’m also a bit of a geek when it comes to thread counts. I need breathable fabrics and silk pillowcases. Raj laughs at me when I order new sheets, and wash them before putting them on the bed.
He raises concerns about the environmental impact of excessive washing and the wear and tear on fabrics. That’s a valid point, but I don’t think he’s serious – he’s just trying to detract from his own grossness. His personal hygiene habits give me the ick.
Our bed still feels fine after a few weeks. There’s just no need to change the sheets before then
Changing your bedsheets once a month is fine, and doesn’t compromise personal hygiene. Our bed still feels fine after a few weeks, and I’ll only change sheets after then. I’ve always been like that – when I was at uni, I probably went two months without changing the sheets.
I just don’t feel the need to wash and launder sheets every few days. It’s excessive. If we were dirtier – say we ate in bed or showered less – washing the sheets more regularly would make sense. But Mandeep and I are both clean individuals who don’t suffer from allergies. She says she has sensitive skin – it’s literally just the odd spot – and blames it on me not changing the bedsheets when she’s away.
We sleep between high-grade sheets. Mandeep is obsessed with decor and interiors and she has spent hundreds on fancy linen. She rattles off thread counts and lectures me on why this fabric or that is better for her hair, or my eye wrinkles. I’ve lost track of how much Mandeep has spent on bedsheets.
Once she’s seen a set she likes online, they’ll be on our bed the next night. She also washes new sheets straight out of the packet before putting them on the bed, which I find unnecessary. Sometimes she even irons our sheets, which is totally pointless because we crease them as we sleep.
It’s great to have someone who cares that much about what we sleep on, but to me this means we don’t need to change the sheets as much. Fancy sheets repel dirt.
Mandeep’s other bedtime habits also have me on the ropes. She has banned all screens from the bedroom, even when I really want to watch something. She also makes me swap pillows with her if I’m lying on her special silk one. Having said all that, it is nice to go to sleep in a beautifully made bed. I don’t do the laundry – that’s Mandeep’s department – but I do all the cooking. That’s not sexist – she just naturally takes more of an interest in the linen. Some might say she’s obsessed.

Raj isn’t guilty for not wanting to change the sheets, but he is guilty of not appreciating the value of what Mandeep does for him. It wouldn’t hurt if Raj washed the sheets every now and then as an act of love, even if he’s burning inside at how ridiculous he thinks it is.Fatima, 29
Raj is extremely lucky that Mandeep provides him with clean sheets every week. His desire to sleep in the same sheets for a month is revolting. However, Mandeep obviously gets a perverse thrill out of obsessing over bed linen (no shade: I can relate), so she should stop badgering Raj to help.Anita, 37
It’s lovely to get into a bed with freshly laundered sheets, but Mandeep has taken the joy out of this by imagining them as breeding grounds for bacteria. She needs to rein in her fear of dirt before it becomes an obsession. Rupert, 65
Not guilty – who has the time to wash their sheets once a week? I do agree with Mandeep that clean bedding equals better sleep, but maybe thinking too much about bedsheets equals even poorer sleep.Tom, 35
Raj thinks that washing the sheets once a month is fine – and it is. This is a matter of preference, not hygiene. If Mandeep wants the linen changed four times a month, then she should do it. Want something your way? Do it yourself.Lola, 35

We asked whether Cathleen should preheat the oven when cooking
81% of you say Cathleen is guilty – her arguments are half-baked
19% of you say Cathleen is not guilty – let’s take the heat out of the situationHe may be dealing with grief or depression, but whatever the cause, your dad needs help to reset his boundaries
I’m an adult living at home with my parents for financial reasons; they are in their late 60s/early 70s.
My father has been watching pornography in shared spaces in the house, usually on his phone and on mute, but I can see it over his shoulder.
I first noticed this happening at night when he thought everyone had gone to bed. My arriving downstairs would result in a furtive jump and him hastily putting the phone down. It has now increased to include times when he is alone in a separate room during the day.
I also need to log out of my streaming services on the family television due to unwanted recommendations resulting from a mysterious watch history. I keep track of the devices logged in and can tell that these entries came from the television in the living room during the day.
I wonder if this is due to loneliness or some other social trigger? I have also observed an increase in his looking at women in the street, but that may just be me noticing more due to hypervigilance caused by the other incidents.
I’m starting to feel extremely uncomfortable in my own home, feeling the need to loudly “announce” my arrival into a room out of a fear of what I might stumble on.
I would like to find a way to broach the subject and gently suggest that these activities would be better confined to a private space, but I don’t want to shame him. If it’s caused by loneliness or something lacking in his life, I don’t want to make this worse. I did try to talk to my mother about it, but the conversation was shut down.
It is important to remember that this is your dad’s “own home” too and, if we set aside the subject matter for a minute, I wonder how comfortable he feels in it at the moment. He may well regard a separate room as a private space.
But let’s address the porn issue. “You’re being exposed to your father’s sexuality,” says psychoanalyst and psychologist Dr Stephen Blumenthal, “in ways that you shouldn’t be.”
There is, of course, a generation of young people now who can’t afford to live independently and this is probably an issue – both ways – for many.
The first thing to do is rule out a neurological reason. “However unlikely, it’s important to rule out cognitive changes connected with ageing, as this might contribute to reduced impulse control,” says Blumenthal. So a trip to the GP may be in order. This may not be easy, I appreciate, neither is it your responsibility to facilitate it. But maybe, if you are approaching it from a health point of view, your mum may help. Are there other symptoms, such as forgetfulness or confusion?
I also discussed with Blumenthal why people watch porn and it may not be as obvious as you think. “It’s often a means of dealing with grief, mourning and depression,” he said. “It’s a way of anaesthetising and he may be at that age where he’s mourning something.”
As you suggest, loneliness may be at the heart of this. It is a distraction for him but it works only while he’s watching it. “In this way it’s like a drug,” said Blumenthal. “It’s very stimulating but then you’re thrown back into feeling ashamed, guilty and even worse than before. It’s a temporary patch for a more permanent problem.” So you are absolutely right not to make him feel ashamed.

If he’s doing it in ways he may be “caught”, this may be a cry for help. But it doesn’t sound like that, more that he has a slight compulsion and can’t help himself.
I’m a strong believer that a child, even an adult one, shouldn’t get involved in the intimate lives of their parents. But it seems as if your dad’s boundaries are getting a little storm-damaged and you may need to rebuild them.
You could ask your dad more generally if he’s OK. You could then try to draw some technical boundaries and show him – without going into the why – how to log out of things “as otherwise people can see everyone else’s history”. This may be enough for him to get the hint. Some streaming services can also be set up to have individual profiles.
If this doesn’t fix the problem then you may have to be as calm and as nonjudgmental as possible and say something like: “I’ve noticed you watching some adult things. I know it’s your house, but I feel uncomfortable sometimes walking into a room you are in.”
I was also interested in your “hypervigilance” with your dad. Some problems lessen in significance when our own lives grow richer.

When Fiona Wood moved to Perth from the UK in 1987, she was drawn to its wildlife. “Intrinsically, it’s the most beautiful place,” she says, as we wander along Matilda Bay beneath a canopy of foliage, the gnarled trunks of moreton bay figs and cape lilacs with their bursts of yellow berries. “When I first came here, I thought, ‘I can see myself sitting under these trees with my thinking cap on’.”
Almost 40 years later, she’s certainly done her share of thinking on these grounds. Just across the road from Matilda Bay is the University of Western Australia, where Wood has worked since in the early ‘90s, first as a senior lecturer, then a professor in the school of surgery and director of the Burn Injury Research Unit. “I’m part of the furniture there,” she tells me in her warm, lilting Yorkshire-cum-Australian accent.
Wood has worn many hats over her 30-year career: plastic surgeon, clinician scientist, burns specialist, researcher, mentor. But like many scientists, she remains fixated on her next discovery – that elusive eureka moment, a chance to push the boundaries of medical knowledge into new realms. Interviewing her is like submitting to a stream of scientific cogitation laced with self-deprecating humour. It’s dizzyingly fast, and totally captivating.
“My staff laugh at me because I’m always trying to connect the dots – I’ll go into meetings and my brain will be scanning the horizon for ideas. They say ‘sometimes we join dots that shouldn’t be joined!’” she tells me, dissolving into laughter. “But I’m not shy when I’m wrong. There’s no such thing as a bad decision, as long as you learn from it.”
Wood is best known for “spray-on skin”, a groundbreaking invention which uses a patient’s own skin cells to form a new layer of skin over a burn wound, greatly reducing scarring. She used this technology to aid the recovery of the 28 Bali bombings victims whose lives were saved in 2002, a feat that saw Wood named a Member of the Order of Australia the following year. Twenty years later, in January 2024, she was honoured with Officer of the Order of Australia for her distinguished service to burns medicine.
The AO joins a raft of roles and accolades Wood has amassed over her prolific career. In addition to her position at UWA, she’s a consultant plastic surgeon at Perth children’s hospital and Fiona Stanley hospital, director of the WA Burns Service, a National Living Treasure, former Australian of the Year and a mother of six.

As we stroll along the river past peppermint trees and a family of black swans, Wood tells me about her current fixation. She’s working to find a solution for the “scarring triangle” – the physical, psychological and physiological changes in some burns victims that make them more vulnerable to future infection, illness and even death.
This long-term research project draws on Wood’s “burn injury biobank”, the world’s largest collection of biological samples from child and adult burn victims, amassed over time to enable longitudinal studies. There are a handful of topics that get Wood really excited, and this is one of them – if all goes to plan, the biobank and its data platform will allow her team to uncover the pathways to secondary illness, and deliver tailored, individual medical care in ways that have never been done before.
“Tailored medicine, precision medicine. That’s the future,” Wood says, eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. “But how do we actually do it? We need an enormous amount of information so we know where you sit on this massive spectrum, whether it be your lipids or your metabolites, your amino acids, your DNA – which requires huge mathematical capability and machine learning.”
“We’re inching closer,” she continues, clenching her first determinedly. “It’s’ ‘batten down the hatches, get a little bit more money, keep going’.”
There was one patient in particular who set her off on this line of inquiry. In 2003, Wood saved the life of a seven-year-old boy who suffered significant burns in a farming accident. Three years later, he died of a rare liver cancer.
“I was told at the time it was just bad luck,” she says. “And that didn’t sit well with me. I can nag for the UK and Australia, and when I’ve got a bee in my bonnet, I don’t give up.”
Since 2010, Wood and her team have published more than 30 studies investigating the links between burn injury and lifetime risk of cancer, inflammatory diseases, mental health and other pathologies – demonstrating that there is indeed a correlation. Their next step is to figure out why.
“We’re very much in the weeds at the moment. We’re looking in the brain, we’re looking at the immune system and we’re looking at the inflammatory profile. If we can figure out who is vulnerable and why and what is the mechanism, then we can start to treat it.”
We sit down on a bench beneath the shade of a soaring lemon-scented gum, to get some respite from the heat. It’s already a sticky 29C at 8:30am, and a thick haze of cloud hangs overhead. Wood tells me about the work she’s been doing in exploring the role of the mind in burn recovery, and how neurology might enable us to “think ourselves whole”.
While the idea might seem outlandish to some, Wood believes neurology could be the holy grail of burns medicine. Currently, very little is known about the brain’s response to serious burns but, as with many of the great mysteries in her research, this only serves to propel her forward.
“We’re experimenting with transcranial magnetic stimulation,” she says. “Many people have started to use this technique in depression and post-stroke rehabilitation, but to understand how we can use neuroplasticity to enable burn recovery would be a huge step forward.”
The conversation continues to chart an astounding breadth of scientific thinking, with Wood navigating effortlessly between regenerative medicine, artificial intelligence and biotechnology – just a few of the new frontiers she’s got her sights on.
Among them, Wood is making progress with a series of new world-first surgery tools. The 3D bioprinter produces cells which replace the dermis, the complex secondary skin layer, to provide a “more complete skin reconstruction”. Wood believes it’ll be ready for a human pilot study in the middle of this year.
Also in development, the iKnife is a new tool which will enable surgeons to distinguish between live and dead tissue, one of the biggest challenges of burn wound surgery. “I’m so excited by this project, it’s going to put my retirement back years,” Wood says. “I think it’s paradigm shifting, but there’s still a lot of work to do.”
Further down the line, Wood and her team will explore options for commercialisation, much like they did for spray-on skin, which was brought to market by Avita Medical. While the company was founded by Wood, she does not own it, and any royalties collected are channelled back into research.
We make our way back towards UWA, where she has her next meeting. Breaks are few and far between for the indefatigable Wood, who spends her days scurrying between the university, Fiona Stanley hospital and Perth children’s hospital. As we stroll along the riverfront, I ask her about the many patients she has saved from life-threatening injury, and what it feels like to see them make a full recovery.
“There was a woman, a triathlete, who sustained shocking burns from the Bali bombings,” she tells me. “When she woke from her coma, she asked me ‘I won’t run, will I ever walk again?’ and I said, ‘you will walk, you will run, you will race’.”
Amazingly, the woman beat Wood in an ironman in Busselton a few years later. “There wasn’t a dry eye as we hugged over the finish line that day.”
We cross the road over to the towering limestone buildings of UWA, a second home for Wood for the last three decades. “You know, it wasn’t until about ten years after the Bali bombings that I realised, maybe I have some vicarious trauma because I found it really challenging to talk about,” she says.
Wood treated 31 survivors of the 2002 blast, who were flown to Royal Perth hospital suffering up to 90% body burns, deadly infections and delayed shock. Her team of 19 surgeons and 130 medical staff worked around the clock to save them. But she lost three patients, and their deaths have never left her.
“There are people that I will never forget, and there are situations that are harrowing, and they’re part of me. The only way I know how to cope is to aggressively engage in this research, to keep discovering.”
“And somewhere along the line, we will change things and we will change them for the better.”From the revival of a London style mecca to TV’s Palm Royale, the decade’s trends are making a comeback
Barbra Streisand once waltzed in without ceremony, Jimi Hendrix was a customer, and John Lennon’s white limo would sometimes pull up outside. Salman Rushdie called it his “60s education in cool”. Granny Takes a Trip, the King’s Road boutique that opened in London in 1966 and became a countercultural hangout, is relaunching with a little help from the Rolling Stones.
Rushdie has written how “to the assorted heads and freaks who hung out there, it was the Mecca, the Olympus, the Kathmandu of hippy chic”.
Inspired by the irreverent spirit of the original, the 2024 digital iteration will work only with secondhand clothing and deadstock fabrics. Looking to the brand’s musical roots, excess clothing from the musical merchandising industry will be transformed into limited edition garments.
The retailer’s chief executive, Marlot te Kiefte, hopes to evoke a similar mood as the original and inspire people to “take a step back and appreciate fashion”. She draws a parallel between the 2020s and the 1960s, with widespread political upheaval, a rise in collectivism, as well as an interest in wellbeing, spirituality and psychedelics.
The relaunch comes amid a wider resurgence of 60s culture and fashion. The recent collaboration between the fashion writer Leandra Medine Cohen and the French brand Soeur has helped usher in a revival of shrunken polo shirts, shift-dress shapes, spacey metallics and short hemlines.
On the small screen, Apple TV’s Palm Royale, set in Palm Beach in the summer of 1969, features the underdog Maxine Simmons who says: “The wealthiest descend to mix and mingle like crabs in a barrel.” But social climbing plays second fiddle to cat-eye sunglasses, headscarves and kaftans. The show’s Emmy-winning costume designer, Alix Friedberg, relies on vintage finds from Dior, Emilio Pucci, Givenchy, Chloé and Chanel.
On the silver screen last year, Sofia Coppola’s film about a young Priscilla Presley put 60s fashions – beehives and all – centre stage. While in London, a show celebrating all things Biba opened last month at the Fashion and Textile Museum. Founded in 1964, it was one of the world’s first lifestyle brands.
The 60s have come out swinging in high fashion too. At Dior, the designer Maria Grazia Chiuri referenced Miss Dior, the ready-to-wear line launched in 1967, for a collection that was soundtracked by the 1969 hit Je T’aime … Moi Non Plus by Serge Gainsbourg and Jane Birkin. At the Chanel show in Manchester in December, there was a hat-tip to the 1960s via baker-boy caps and tweed skirt suits in acid brights accompanied by Mary Janes. While at Celine, Twiggy acted as muse for the shift dresses and miniskirts.
The mood seems to be rubbing off on younger generations – on the secondhand site Depop, a favourite with gen Z, searches for miniskirts are up 30%, baker-boy hats by 17% and leopard print by 235%. Polo necks are also trending.
On Pinterest, searches for Biba are up 65% and searches for 60s styles, 60s outfits and shift dresses have risen by 30%. The number of people looking for leopard-print outfit inspiration has increased sevenfold.
What is behind the 60s resurgence? Fashion and the wider world is in a period of upheaval and, perhaps seeking comfort, is in an increasingly nostalgic mood.
The recent deaths of 60s style leaders may also be affecting the mood. Having made miniskirts fashionable, Mary Quant, who once described the garment as representing “life and tremendous opportunity”, died at 93, catalysing a moment of remembrance and celebration of her mark on fashion.
The late model and actor Birkin has continued to set trends in death as in life. Her death last summer has triggered a boom in fashion inspired by her signature Gallic style on resale sites such as Vestiaire Collective. And the overstuffed handbag with which she is associated has been a surprisingly far-reaching styling trick – on TikTok there are tutorials on how to Birk-ify your bag.
But this is about much more than the passing of style heroes. The fashion historian Tony Glenville says the decade may also be experiencing a revival because “the short clean look of much of the 60s is a great antidote to layering and volume”. He thinks that decade was “so different to now; it was optimistic and about change, rights, short skirts … It was all fun”.
In 2024, a financially strained time in the UK, when “we’re not socialising, not working and not having fun”, Glenville says the 60s may be particularly appealing. “[Looking back] through rose-tinted glasses, [people] were social, clubs [were] starting, [people were] out and about, exploring new things, [it was] possible … to have fun on little money.”After a stuffy, centrally-heated winter, it’s time to repot, feed and refresh your green companions
There was a time when my houseplants got the best of me. Devoted care, weekend afternoons dedicated to careful propagation, gentle misting, regular watering. I’d carefully snip the brown bits off the edges of their leaves and delicately remove the buildup of dust with a microfibre cloth. My flat was a growing cornucopia of cacti and vines and succulents, all in a coterie of artisanal pots.
But that was in 2014, when I lived in a flat that was bleached with daylight and I had very few demands on my time. A decade on and the houseplant trend has ballooned (thank you, lockdown) but my tolerance and time for them has shrunk considerably.
The #houseplantgang that bedecked my G-Plan sideboard broke up with an old relationship. I’ve since moved several times and had a baby. Now my “collection” consists of Christopher Figgins, the name I gave my fiddle leaf fig tree (Ficus lyrata), a profligate spider plant (Chlorophytum comosum) called Donna, a fancy blue star fern (Phlebodium aureum) named after Fenella Fielding, and an extremely tolerant rubber plant (Ficus elastica).
This is the time of year they’ll get the most attention. They’ve survived another winter of drying central heating and slow growth without attracting an infestation of fungus gnats (awful, if harmless – nematodes will keep them at bay but so will putting your plants outside somewhere sheltered) and deserve some TLC.

Most of our houseplants are meant to grow outdoors in much warmer climes, but if we keep them captive in pots on windowsills there are some things that can make it more pleasant for them.
Now that the days are longer, these plants will be getting the hours of light they need, which means they’re likely to put on growth. This can be ushered along by repotting plants that have outgrown their existing containers. Check to see if roots are growing out of the drainage holes of the pot, or stems are pushing up against its edges. Find a pot that is about a finger’s width larger in circumference – if you put a plant into a new pot that is too large, the fresh soil will soak up moisture, increasing the risk of root rot. Water the plant well before you lift and move it into its new pot, fill in the gap with peat-free compost (multipurpose or houseplant-specific), and water it again once it is in. Make sure you leave the pot to drain off somewhere – I use the kitchen sink.
Fresh compost will fuel the new season’s growth for a few weeks but applying liquid plant food – I use an organic seaweed feed – after you’ve watered every couple of weeks will keep it going. Keep an eye on your watering; growing plants will probably be thirstier.We want to speak with teachers from Jamaica and other countries that have seen a rise in those moving to a job in England

Allegations of more than $10,000 for cocaine, fine dining, rounds of golf, massages and sex workers in exchange for a television interview.
The leaking of an alleged rape victim’s private text messages to national media.
Internecine feuds within Australia’s blokey TV media.
The defamation trial brought by former Australian political staffer Bruce Lehrmann, in all its “sordid” mess (to quote the judge), has gripped Australia this week.
It is a rare federal court trial that attracts tens of thousands of viewers on YouTube, especially one linked to a case that is so long-running and complex..
It began when Brittany Higgins, a political staffer, alleged that her colleague Bruce Lehrmann raped her in parliament house after a night out in 2019. Higgins gave a TV interview – on Channel 10 – and her allegation became totemic for the broader #MeToo movement in Australia.
Lehrmann was charged, but has always denied the allegation and his criminal trial was delayed, first by an public speech given by one of the journalists involved in the Higgins’ interview, and then derailed by juror misconduct.
After the trial was abandoned, prosecutors declined to pursue a re-trial because they feared for Higgins’s mental health.
In the aftermath of the criminal trial, Lehrmann sued Channel 10 over the interview for defamation.
A rival television channel – Channel Seven – then broadcast an interview with Lehrmann in 2023. This week the defamation trial heard allegations from the story’s producer – a now former Channel Seven employee – that Seven paid more than $10,000 (£5,211) for, among other things, sex workers and cocaine, in order to secure Lehrmann’s agreement to interview. The network also claimed “no one was paid” for the interview, until it was discovered it had footed the bill for Lehrmann’s rent for a year – more than $100,000.
Former Channel Seven producer Taylor Auerbach – a last-minute surprise witness – this week testified he was given the job of being Lehrmann’s “babysitter”, and to coax him into signing an exclusive interview agreement.
The pair golfed in Tasmania, and dined on $361 steak, all paid for by the TV station, the court heard. When Lehrmann allegedly bought cocaine during one dinner in Sydney, and then started Googling sex workers, Auerbach claims he texted his concerns to his bosses.
“He’s on the warpath again.
“This is fucked.”
In his closing statement to the court, Matt Collins KC, for Ten, described the alleged tactics used to get Lehrmann to sign on for the interview as part of a “perverse universe”.
“And somehow, in the perverse universe in which this program was apparently operating, Mr Auerbach was not terminated for spending more than $10,000 on the company credit card on illicit activities in connection with getting the story of the year,” Collins said.
Tawdry as that all may be, there is an even more serious allegation: that Lehrmann leaked sensitive information - private text messages and sensitive documents belonging to Higgins - that he obtained as part of the criminal trial, and that he was bound not to share or use for any other purpose. Lehrmann has testified, under oath in court, that he did not share the documents with Channel Seven.
Auerbach has sought to condemn Seven in his testimony, but he has been accused of similar: the court was played a bizarre video of him breaking all of the golf clubs of a former colleague he testified he now hates.
Seven has denied all claims made by Auerbach, dismising him as a disgruntled ex employee.
“The person involved admitted to the misuse of a Seven corporate card and all unauthorised expenses were immediately reimbursed. Seven has acted appropriately at all times.”
Save for the occasional intervention of a bemused Justice Michael Lee, the trial has been a bleak, if compelling, spectacle.
The judgment is expected shortly.This species has rapidly spread through western Europe, with a huge impact on other flying insect populations
We live in dark times. Storm clouds gather over our nations, politics and planet. Let rip the end of days. We’re entering an era of suffering, tyranny and predatory, invasive wasps. So vote baddie. Vote end times. Vote for the Asian or yellow-legged hornet.
Like Trump, Putin, Netanyahu and Lee Anderson, this mortal creature is both terrifying and weird in its implausible lust for power and domination.
Native to south-east Asia, the yellow-legged hornet’s European conquest began in 2004 when a single mated queen stowed away in a container-load of pottery that arrived in the port of Bordeaux from China. Incredibly, it is believed that the entire rapidly spreading European population of yellow-legged hornets is derived from this one individual.
This hornet is actually smaller than our native ginger-hued hornet, and rather neat-looking with its yellow stripes and black trim. But it has a voracious appetite for native bees and wasps, and honeybees, and its colonies rapidly expand in summertime when it builds nests the size of a large watermelon, often high in trees.
Collectively, these colonies have a huge impact on flying insect populations. The hornets will hover outside beehives and jump on their prey, not just taking numerous bees but also creating a landscape of fear that sometimes paralyses a honeybee colony, preventing worker bees from foraging for food. French researchers estimate a single nest can consume 11.3kg of wild insects over its late summer lifetime.
The hornet has rapidly spread through western Europe. In Portugal, beekeepers say honey production in the north and centre of the country has fallen by more than 35% because of the hornets. Hives that used to produce 12kg of honey each year now produce 4-5kg.
The first yellow-legged hornet sighting in Britain was in 2016. The species is not thought capable of crossing the Channel under its own steam but hitches a ride on ships. British winters would once have been too cold for it, but global heating is changing that.
In 2020, 2021 and 2022 there were only two or fewer confirmed sightings of the hornet on mainland Britain. But last year they properly invaded. The government recorded 78 sightings, mostly of entire nests – burgeoning colonies – which were destroyed.
That is the tip of the coming iceberg. The island of Jersey has made a heroic attempt to eradicate the species (which flies there easily from the French mainland) but underwhelming British efforts will not keep this predator at bay.
So vote yellow-legged or Asian hornet – the perfect invertebrate symbol of our times: aggressive, destructive, and given a whole new lease of life by us, careless colluders in the capitalist-democratic implosion that imperils the whole planet.
Welcome to the Guardian’s UK invertebrate of the year competition. Every day between 2 April and 12 April we’ll be profiling one of the incredible invertebrates that live in and around the UK. Let us know which invertebrates you think we should be including here. And at midnight on Friday 12 April, voting will open to decide which is our favourite invertebrate – for now – with the winner to be announced on Monday 15 April.Honeybees tend to get the most attention, but in Britain alone there are about 270 species of bee
Honeybees turn nectar into honey. Plenty of other insects drink the sweet energy drink produced by flowers to fuel their flight, but no other stockpiles a concentrated version of it to see it through the winter. And we’ve prized this natural sweetener for thousands of years for its culinary and medicinal qualities.
Honeybees also secrete wax from a gland to construct their honeycomb home of hexagonal wax cells. And we have harvested it for centuries to make candles and seal documents.
They live in large colonies consisting of foraging workers, male drones and an egg-laying queen, which are component parts of a system that operate together as part of a whole in what entomologists call a superorganism. Incredibly for a tiny insect, they can convey distance and direction in relation to the sun to their co-workers by performing a waggle dance, which allows the colony to forage more efficiently than by smell and vision.
But honeybees are not the only clever bees. Rounder, hairier bumblebees, which live in smaller less structured colonies and whose plump appearance seems to defy the laws of aerodynamics, have been found to be able to learn complex, multistep tasks through social interaction.
Fascinating as they are, honeybees and bumblebees account for only 1% of the estimated 25,000 bee species worldwide. Most neither make honey, nor live in colonies, nor do they sting or have stripes. Even in the UK, where there are about 270 species of bee, only one is a honeybee. The vast majority are small brown solitary bees, nesting alone – although often next door to each other – in nooks and crannies or burrowing underground. These bees are wild, unlike honeybees that live in manmade hives and are managed by beekeepers.
What all bees share is that they play cupid to their favourite flowers. And this is what makes bees truly wonderful: they are flowering plants’ romantic go-betweens. Bees and flowering plants have co-evolved over 100m years, since bees broke away from wasps to become vegan, swapping meat protein for pollen. As well as being the only source of protein that bees collect to feed their young, pollen grains contain a plant’s sperm cells and they require an agent to transport them from the male part of the flower, the stamen, to the female stigma in order for the ovaries to produce seeds.
A bee is perfectly designed for this role. The hairs on its body and legs carry a positive electrical charge that attracts the negative-charged pollen grains, so as it forages for pollen and nectar it inadvertently brushes some pollen from one flower head to another. And some wild bees use a special technique called “buzz pollination” to shake the pollen from the plant.
The 20th-century Lebanese–American poet Kahlil Gibran beautifully describes the bee and plant’s symbiotic relationship: “To the bee, a flower is the fountain of life, and to the flower the bee is a messenger of love.”
So successful is the relationship that an estimated one in three mouthfuls we eat come from flowering plants pollinated by bees – most fruits and vegetables, herbs and spices, seeds and nuts, and coffee.

Bees’ are a linchpin in the natural world, their pollination services producing seeds and berries for birds and small mammals that form an important part of nature’s food chain.
Oligolectic bees have adapted to feed mainly on one type of flower, timing their short life cycle for when the plant blooms, as with the autumn-flying ivy bee. Others are more generalists. But wherever there are flowering plants, from windswept mountaintops to humid jungles and arid deserts and even near the north pole – home to the Arctic bumblebee (Bombus polaris) – there will be bees to pollinate them. The kaleidoscope of colours and myriad perfumes are all designed to attract their master pollinator. So it is bees we have to thank for the beauty and scent of the flowering world.

Benjamin Netanyahu’s claim that the Israeli military’s killing of seven World Central Kitchen aid workers in Gaza on Monday night was “a tragic incident” did precious little to allay the fears of Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. Nor did his assertion that “this happens in wartime”.
Sánchez, who has been one of the most outspoken and persistent European critics of the way in which Israel has prosecuted its war in Gaza after the terrorist atrocities of 7 October, described the Israeli prime minister’s “supposed explanations” as “totally unacceptable and insufficient”. He added that Spain was waiting for a full and detailed account of the killings before deciding “what action we’ll take with regard to the government of Prime Minister Netanyahu”.
Sánchez’s latest remarks – along with his announcement on Monday that Spain intends to recognise a Palestinian state by July – are a further example of how some of the more habitually taciturn members of the EU have found themselves compelled to speak up amid concerns that the bloc is failing to live up to its moral, political and humanitarian duties.
While condemning Hamas’s “shocking acts of terrorism” and acknowledging Israel’s right to defend itself, Sánchez has infuriated Netanyahu’s government by calling the number of dead Palestinians “truly unbearable”, and emphasising that Israel’s response cannot include “the deaths of innocent civilians, including thousands of children”. Spain’s socialist prime minister has also said he has “genuine doubts” about whether Israel is complying with international humanitarian law in its offensive in Gaza.
In an interview with al-Jazeera on Thursday afternoon, Sánchez said Israel’s actions in Gaza could even lead the EU to debate “whether we continue with this strategic relation or not”.
The language from Ireland, which is widely perceived as the most pro-Palestinian voice in the EU, has been similarly unvarnished. The outgoing taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, has described the assault as “approaching revenge”, while the foreign minister, Micheál Martin, has said it was “disproportionate”.
Some European diplomats feel history will not look kindly on the EU’s inclination to look the other way on Israel and Gaza when the bloc was all too prepared to call out Russia’s actions in Ukraine. One senior diplomatic source told the Guardian that Spain and Ireland’s strong positions on Palestine were beginning to pay off, adding that each time Madrid and Dublin spoke out, the loneliness of their stance faded and others were emboldened to join them.
Both Sánchez and Spain’s foreign minister, José Manuel Albares, are adamant that the two-state solution remains the only answer to the crisis in the Middle East – hence the Spanish government’s urgency in recognising a Palestinian state.
“If we look at the medium and long term, if we don’t do something differently to how we have been acting in the last decade, we will see this spiral of violence once again. And in order to do that [something different] … we need a real and valuable Palestinian state,” Albares told reporters in Brussels on Wednesday. “That’s why we are going to recognise the state of Palestine.”
Albares also pointed out that the recognition of a Palestinian state had long been a key foreign policy commitment for Sánchez’s Spanish Socialist Worker’s party (PSOE). The EU’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, himself a former Spanish foreign minister, has also made his feelings plain when it comes to Israel’s offensive in Gaza.
“Which are the other solutions they have in mind?” Borrell said in January. “To make all the Palestinians leave? To kill them? Twenty-five thousand already in Gaza, 70% women and children. Certainly, the way of trying to destroy Hamas is not the way they are doing, because they are seeding the hate for generations.”
Dublin has been seeking to make common cause with like-minded members and has calibrated its statements to nudge, but not subvert, the EU foreign policy mainstream. As well as teaming up with Spain, Slovenia and Malta last month to express a readiness to recognise Palestinian statehood, it has partnered with Spain to prod the EU into reviewing an Israel trade deal over human rights obligations.
Last week Ireland announced it would intervene in South Africa’s landmark international court of justice case against Israel by attempting to widen the definition of genocide to include blocking aid.

“Clearly an entire population is being impacted here not just through the bombing but through starvation,” Martin, told the Guardian. “We’ve experienced famine, we know what it’s like in our psyche,” he said, citing the 1840s disaster known as the Great Hunger.
Martin linked Dublin’s response to the devastation in Gaza with an Irish foreign policy tradition of seeking to curb certain weapons, such as cluster munitions, and promoting humanitarian corridors in Syria, Ethiopia and other conflicts.
Martin said he expected Ireland’s foreign policy to remain unchanged under Simon Harris, who is due to succeed Varadkar as taoiseach next week. “We’ve worked with Simon Harris for the last four years in government, so we don’t anticipate any major issues around the content of foreign policy,” he said.
Irish diplomats and analysts say Ireland’s colonial history has predisposed it to back the underdog. It was the first EU state to endorse Palestinian statehood in 1980. Even so, Ireland strives to remain within the EU consensus, said Niall Holohan, who served as Ireland’s representative to the Palestinian Authority from 2002 to 2006.
Israel has accused Dublin of giving succour to Hamas, whose 7 October attack on southern Israel triggered the war, but domestically the Irish government has faced accusations of being too soft on Israel. Opposition parties have pushed for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador and proposed a law that would ban the Irish state from investing in companies that operate in illegal Israeli settlements, moves the government has resisted.
Sánchez’s erstwhile allies in the far-left Podemos party have also been forthright in their condemnation, accusing Israel of planning a “genocide” against the Palestinian people and calling for Netanyahu to be brought before the international criminal court to face war crimes charges.
As European and international exasperation increases, some diplomats blame the continued division in the bloc on the early unconditional support for Israel given by the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, arguing it would not be at odds if she had clearly mentioned Israel’s obligation to observe human rights in her initial support of the country’s right to defend itself.
Six months on, waiting for a change in the status quo is simply no longer an option for many. “If we wait for the 27 member states [to recognise Palestine] we will be waiting for ever,” said one senior diplomat.Residents of tourist city near epicentre of 7.2-magnitude Taiwan earthquake face destruction and despair
Lying in his bed, Liao Xiu Bo wondered if he was about to die. As a powerful earthquake rocked the ground beneath him, he tried to escape his house. “Am I going to be crushed?” he asked himself, before gathering the courage to run down the stairs, which swayed beneath his feet.
Outside, he could see that the wall surrounding his house had collapsed, its bricks littered across the road. “That’s when I realised how extreme the earthquake was.”
Liao’s house in Hualien, a popular tourist city on the east coast of Taiwan, was just a few miles from the epicentre of the 7.2-magnitude quake that struck on Wednesday morning. The quake has left more than 1,000 people injured and at least 10 dead. On Friday, rescuers were still looking for 18 people missing.
“In Hualien, earthquakes are a part of everyday life,” Liao said. “But this earthquake was different from the others.” And worse was to come.
As Liao assessed the damage to his home on Wednesday morning, he saw on the news that the Uranus building, only a few blocks away, had partly collapsed.
His thoughts immediately went to his friend and longtime customer at his bar who lived in the building. “I started calling her but I couldn’t get through. I recorded a short voice memo and said: ‘I saw the news. Can you send me a message? I’m really worried if you’re safe.’”
She never responded.
Having initially escaped the crumbling building, she had returned to rescue her cat, only for the walls to collapse around her, Liao said. “She was only 33 years old. She was such a bright and kind-hearted person. When I heard the news, I felt like I’d lost a family member.”
In the east of the city, next to a normally bustling night market, the 10-storey Uranus is slumped at an awkward angle after its lower floors collapsed during the quake. The building, now being prepared for demolition, has come to represent the damage wreaked by the largest earthquake to hit Taiwan in 25 years.
It is among the 176 buildings across Hualien that have been damaged or destroyed because of the quake, which has also left about 337 households without electricity and 3,750 without water, according to local government officials.
As the earthquake began, Li Gomez, 47, was on the eighth floor of her hotel with her husband and two young daughters. “The pipes had burst and water was pouring in. Things were falling off the wall and the whole building was shaking violently,” she said.
“One of the workers in the hotel grabbed my daughter while I tried to get the door open, and then my husband ran over to get our other daughter. We ran out; we didn’t even think about putting our shoes on.”
They made their way to the train station but struggled to find a route out of the city. Many of the roads in and around Hualien, as well as the train lines linking to neighbouring cities, had sustained significant damage.
Unable to leave, they found themselves among the 213 displaced people scattered across makeshift rescue centres in schools and other municipal buildings.
Tending to her 94-year-old husband, Song De You, 66, said she left behind all her belongings when she came to the rescue centre in Zhonghua elementary school.
“I only brought my husband’s necessities and medicines with us because he has cancer,” she said of her spouse, who uses a wheelchair.
With the number of aftershocks exceeding 300, and 76 buildings at risk of collapse, the number of people seeking shelter could increase over the coming days. “I can feel the earthquake in me as if it’s still happening. I feel dizzy and everything is still moving,” Song said.
As residents in Hualien slowly return to life as normal, emergency services are working to rescue dozens of people who remain trapped in the mountains in nearby Taroko national park.
“Hualien is a beautiful mountain and water environment,” said Jaw-Yeuan Wu, the chief of the Hualien County fire department, coordinating the rescue effort. “But all these environments have a problem in common – they are particularly prone to rockslides, which is what has happened now.
“Because the places where people have become stranded are all relatively remote, they are not easily reached by first responders or communication equipment.”
With regular aftershocks shaking Hualien and bad weather setting in, the risk of landslides leaves rescuers racing against time. “If we don’t get the trapped people out fast enough the first time, they could be injured a second or third time when the aftershocks take place,” the fire chief said.A supermarket is using eye-tracking technology to find what messaging encourages take-up of unpackaged fruit and veg
With thick black frames and hidden cameras, the glasses look designed for espionage or the metaverse but instead the eye-tracking headgear is being deployed to get inside shoppers’ heads as part of the drive to cut plastic packaging from the weekly food shop.
It is an unlikely scene. Hooked up with the glasses a shopper is being tailed around a Waitrose produce department by a researcher carrying a large tablet that displays live footage of them picking up banal things such as potatoes, apples and bananas.
While not cinematic the film clips will be analysed by experts who are looking at the in-store messages that are the most effective at getting people to switch from buying pre-packaged fruit and veg to picking and weighing their own.
The store in Thatcham, Berkshire, is being used to see if prompts such as “same quality, no packaging” and “perfectly packaged by nature” can help break a cycle that contributes to UK households throwing away nearly 100bn pieces of plastic packaging a year.
Shoppers have got used to the “convenience” of plastic packaging, says Joanna Linley of the anti-waste charity Wrap, who helped set up the trial. “Regardless of what we say, and what we know we should do, realistically when we go into a shop grabbing a bag of something is much easier and more convenient than buying something loose.”
In 2018 UK supermarkets and food companies signed up to voluntary targets to cut plastic packaging over the next seven years. The goals of the UK Plastics Pact – which is led by Wrap, whose work helps shape government policy on sustainability matters – include 30% of all fresh produce being sold loose by 2025.
However, the industry looks set to miss that target. A progress report published late last year said that in 2022 an average of 19.4% of fresh produce sales was loose, with the proportion by retailer varying from 2% to 30%.
There are compelling reasons to “choose loose”. Fresh fruit and veg is responsible for more food waste than anything else we buy, with 1.6m tonnes – nearly £4bn worth – thrown away each year. Removing the packaging should mean less plastic and food waste because households will be able to buy closer to the right amount.
But at the moment supermarkets offer primarily pre-packaged produce because that is what sells, and people buy it because that is on the shelves. In 2019 Iceland abandoned a loose produce trial after it led to a 30% drop in sales. “I certainly can’t justify investing millions in new tills and scales to offer something our customers don’t want to buy,” said its boss, Richard Walker, at the time.
Part of the reason packaging keeps sales higher is that shoppers pay more when they buy a bagged kilo of spuds instead of just the three or four they need. However, many also seem to prefer the convenience and perceived hygiene benefits of pre-priced packets.
A recent Wrap study on the topic included some telling customer testimonials. One said: “I do a serious job and I have lots of things to think about … so when I go to Aldi I don’t want to have a debate about what I’m doing.” Others said they were put off by the thought of “other people touching the fruit” or simply “like the convenience” of picking up a packet.
The study concluded that for loose to become the norm again it was not as simple as asking people or supermarkets to change. “We will need interventions that work across the system, shifting the environments, incentives and norms that drive the buying and selling of pre-packaged fruit and veg,” it said.
“The biggest thing we need is for people to choose loose when it’s available,” says Linley. “It’s obviously great asking the retailers to sell more loose but if people aren’t choosing it, then there’s a real disconnect.”
Waitrose currently sells roughly 100 loose produce lines (about 16% of its range) and did not change the level of choice for the trial. The retailer is committed to offering more loose fruit and veg in store, says Catherine Loader, its sustainability manager, but the reality is complicated. There is no point removing packaging if it means more is then required in the supply chain, for example.
“One of the biggest challenges is that customers pick up items, go to the weighing scales, and then only at that point realise how much they’re actually going to be paying,” says Loader. “That’s something that we’ve been working on … how do we move to per piece pricing, so it’s really clear.”
As well as eye-tracking data that will create a “heat map” of the most effective signage, another 300 Waitrose shoppers will be interviewed – split across Thatcham and a “control” store. The results will be shared with rival supermarkets.
Rachel Green, who has popped into the store during her lunch break, has not noticed the signs but already buys loose anyway. “I think it’s quite nice that you can actually touch what you are buying,” she says. “I go home and wash it anyway.”
Another shopper, who has just recycled a bag of soft plastic packaging in store, says she “can’t be bothered to fiddle around counting out potatoes” as she needs a lot so is going to pay more for the ease of picking up a bag. Potatoes are the UK’s most wasted food with nearly 3m thrown away every day.
Faced with the same plastic problem countries such as France have passed laws banning packaging on many products and it has been reported that the UK government is considering introducing new guidelines. Tesco, the UK’s biggest supermarket, has said it would welcome “effective government intervention on produce packaging removal”.
“This should start with products we think are most achievable – for example where multiple retailers share the same supplier,” wrote Ashwin Prasad, Tesco’s chief product officer, in its 2023 packaging update report. “Government intervention will ensure change is made at scale and create a level playing field – where packaging changes will not put any one retailer at a competitive disadvantage.”
Asked about the reports of a packaging ban, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs says only that it is “leading the global effort to reduce food waste with a commitment to halve it by 2030” and “continued to support Wrap on their campaigns”.
Wrap is now conducting a global policy review of legislation in this area and says: “Any policy (ban or otherwise) that is considered should be developed in consultation with industry to avoid any negative unintended consequences. At this time, no changes in the law have been announced.”In the state of La Guajira, ambitious plans to transition to renewables are beset by bureaucratic delays and anger from many local Indigenous people, who see it as ‘new colonialism’
A few years ago, as age began to take its toll, Rosa Velásquez decided it was time to leave the restaurant she owned in the coastal town of Cabo de la Vela and move back home for a peaceful retirement.. However, when she returned to the tiny rural community of Jotomana, on the arid plains of Colombia’s northernmost tip, she found the place she and her ancestors had called home for generations littered with giant wind turbines.
Towering white turbines punctuate the horizon a few miles from Cabo de la Vela. The region, in the northern state of La Guajira, is home to all of Colombia’s windfarms and its largest Indigenous population, the Wayúu.
“We live among turbines. The companies like them, but I don’t. Where am I to go if this is my territory? What are my grandchildren going to do once I die?” asks Velásquez, a Wayúu herself, as goats roam around her property under the blistering sun.
La Guajira, Colombia’s second-poorest state, has become the focal point and battleground of the government’s proposed energy transition, a push to develop renewable energy sources and reduce its dependency on oil and coal to tackle the climate crisis.
According to La Guajira’s chamber of commerce, the state has solar radiation levels 60% higher than the national average and wind speeds double the global norm. Private companies and Colombia’s mines and energy ministry had sought to capitalise on these factors – even before Gustavo Petro’s leftist government set out its ambitions for a “just energy transition”.
The renewables sector could see investments reach $2.2bn (£1.75bn) this year, much of that being funnelled into the region. La Guajira has 17 renewable energy projects in development, with plans for dozens more to follow – including many offshore windfarms.
The Bogotá-based development organisation Indepaz, which has long tracked the development of renewable energy in La Guajira, has found 57 windfarm projects in various stages of completion.
When Colombia’s energy ministry began fostering the renewables industry in 2019, under Petro’s conservative predecessor Iván Duque, it was hoped such projects would make up 15% of the national power supply by 2023.
However, those ambitious plans have not yet materialised. By the end of last year, less than 2% of Colombia’s power came from non-conventional renewable sources, such as wind or solar.
In Colombia, the development of windfarms is a cumbersome process, with most projects facing severe obstacles and long delays. In July, the energy ministry admitted that 82% of windfarm projects in La Guajira were behind schedule.
Industry bodies share concerns over the pace of development. SER Colombia revealed in January that 65% of projects across the country forecast to begin operations this year were delayed, many significantly.
Bureaucracy means that small renewable energy projects in Colombia typically take three to six years to become operational, according to SER Colombia.
The delays are so bad that several companies have scrapped their plans altogether. The Italian energy company Enel announced last May that it was “indefinitely suspending” the construction of its 200MW Windpeshi project – which stagnated for months with just 35% of the work completed – while Colombia’s Celsia is contemplating the sale of its two stalled projects in La Guajira.
Resistance from Indigenous communities is one reason for the delays to the region’s windfarms, says Aníbal Mercado, head of the regional Wayúu council, known as a Pütchipü’üi or a Palabrero. He blames the failure by companies and the government to enter into dialogue with local people and understand the complexities of La Guajira.
“The rights of the communities have been violated,” he says, blaming the authorities for not explaining the effects, protecting local small businesses, and not respecting land rights or the “spiritual and cultural aspects that sustain these communities”.
Irene Vélez, a former mines and energy minister under Petro, says one of her concerns while leading the government’s energy transition efforts was that officials and industry failed to appreciate the need for a good understanding of local communities to operate successfully in the region.
“From the beginning, I insisted that these projects’ difficulties weren’t technical but social,” says Vélez.
Under Duque, she says, energy companies were required to funnel only 1% of their royalties from renewable projects back into affected communities. She increased that figure to 6%.
“The auctions for construction permits did not consider adequate distribution of benefits for local communities,” Vélez says.
“They perceive these projects as having the same exploitative dynamic of the old [extractivist] model and do not see benefits. So, of course, they oppose them,” she says.
Dialogue between the area’s different communities is another challenge. Indigenous people in La Guajira are widely dispersed among rural communities, or rancherías, that often struggle to agree on windfarm development.

“There is no unity between us; there are many differences between families and communities,” says Luis Arturo Barliza, who represents the tiny windswept community of Casa Eléctrica, where it has been proposed to site a windfarm.
Although he considers windfarms to be “good business”, he is caught in a family feud over a windfarm on their territory. “We need to manage it well for things to be done equitably. But now, things don’t seem to be going that way,” says Barliza.
Isabel Preciado, an energy and climate researcher at the environmental organisation Censat Agua Viva, says: “The approach is woeful because they [government and companies] ignore the territorial context and the complex organisation among the Wayúu.”
Nonetheless, not all Indigenous people in the area are against windfarms. Elva María Velásquez recalls her mother walking out, machete in hand, to meet company representatives and express her opposition to windfarms on her land. Despite her resistance, however, the family moved out a few years ago to make way for the Guajira 1 windfarm.
Velásquez now lives near the farm in a new home built by the company. She is glad to have a brick house with a solar panel, a new kitchen and freezer; it is a significant upgrade from the simple wooden hut she lived in before.
For many people in La Guajira, who feel perennially ignored by officials in Bogotá, the arrival of private energy companies to their territory has brought development and support that the state has failed to deliver.
Companies have provided fresh drinking water – a resource that rural communities desperately lack – as well as solar panels, generators and improvements to homes and schools. People have also had wiring and sockets installed but, despite promises that electricity would be provided by December, they are still not connected to the grid.
Luis Carlos Iguarán, from the tiny community of Lanshalía, appreciates the changes. “It’s progress for us and our communities because it changes our way of life and conditions, and there will be more opportunities,” he says.
Despite the Petro government’s vow to usher in a new age of green energy, the prospect of such a transition happening through La Guajira is slim – especially considering that the president may have only two years left in office.
Joanna Barney, director of environment, energy and communities at Indepaz, says: “We don’t have [an energy] transition in Colombia, but rather a diversification of the power grid to supposedly support new energies.”.
She regards the projects as a “new type of colonialism”, stressing: “At the end of the day, it’s business. It has nothing to do with the environment.”
Colombia’s mines and energy ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
Vélez, Petro’s former minister, admits that the government’s energy transition “has its challenges”. Yet she believes it is still “the path to follow in this government and hopefully those that follow”.
The government is proposing not only to expand green energy but also to end extractive industries, she says. “That is the most challenging energy transition situation, as some sectors do not want to replace the [current economic] model.”
With the clock ticking for Petro and his promise to steer Colombia towards a greener future, scepticism and frustration are adding to the obstacles his ambitions for the energy sector are already facing, raising further questions about the viability of his environmental agenda.
“Whatever you do in La Guajira – if you do not have the social sensitivity that comes from having been in the territory and getting to know it – is detrimental,” Barney says. “It’s simply money thrown away.”Primates are symbol of Lopburi but residents have had enough as monkeys resort to violence to get food
Mischievous long-tailed macaques are, for many, a symbol of the Thai city of Lopburi. Tourists flock to the city’s ancient temple to feed the macaques fresh fruit and photograph them as they maraud the streets. But, increasingly, residents say they have had enough.
This week, after growing complaints from residents, wildlife officials announced a plan to round up 2,500 of the urban monkeys and place them in large enclosures. It follows an incident in March where a woman’s knee wasdislocated after she was kicked in the back by a monkey that wanted her food. Separately, a man lost control of his motorcycle after a monkey tried to grab a bag of food from him.
“I don’t want humans to have to hurt monkeys, and I don’t want monkeys to have to hurt humans,” Athapol Charoenshunsa, the director general of the department of national parks, wildlife and plant conservation, said at a news conference.
Some people have fed the monkeys for generations and feel they are part of the city’s identity. Others say the macaque population has grown too big and that the animals are damaging to businesses and properties and are endangering people’s health.
“People say that if there are no monkeys, then it is not Lopburi,” one resident, Phairoth, told the Thai broadcaster Channel 3. “I want people who say that to take a monkey into their own house and look after it. Let’s share them, five per house, 10 per house. I’ll help deliver the food to their house as well.”
The monkeys are infamous for ambushing people and businesses in search of snacks. Some food sellers have resorted to carrying slingshots to threaten the animals if they approach. Shops have installed metal grilles and displayed large toy animals – crocodiles or tigers – to deter the intruders. When the Thai prime minister, Srettha Thavisin, visited the city this year, residents tried to hand him a printed frame of an image that had gone viral on social media of a young girl holding a toy gun to warn off monkeys as she walked through the city.

Athapol said he expected the first phase of the catching operation to start within weeks and that the enclosures would be big enough to contain thousands of monkeys. A small number of macaques would be allowed to remain in the city.
Wildlife authorities began rounding up the most aggressive males last week, catching 37 so far. According to Thai media, four gang leaders are among those that were caught. A fifth monkey, known for stealing underwear and necklaces from a shop, is still free.
Rival troops of monkeys occupy different buildings, including a derelict cinema. Monkeys that were caught would be kept in enclosures for their group, authorities said.
“There are people who like monkeys, while others don’t. I think that, compared to 10 years ago, the population of monkeys has increased significantly,” said resident Job Jirapat, adding that she understood both sides.
The authorities have run sterilisation campaigns, and from 2014-23 neutered about 2,600 macaques.
Female monkeys are able to reproduce twice a year, and the abundance of high-sugar treats given over recent decades has meant they have plenty of energy to do so. Last year, the population totalled 5,709.
“If sterilisation can be carried out consistently, it is a good long-term solution,” said Job. “I have a feeling that the government didn’t take it seriously. It is possible that they were not able to continue because of a lack of funding, which is why the number of monkeys is increasing so quickly. Another thing that we should do is stop feeding monkeys.”
Experts have previously called for greater education about what type of food can be given to monkeys, and how and when they should be fed. The province celebrates an annual “monkey buffet” festival, where the monkeys are given huge feasts of fruit and other treats.
Athapol said the phased roundup of monkeys kwould “solve the problem very quickly” but some people are sceptical. “If the officers only capture a few ones or only the mean ones, then, to be honest, it won’t make any difference,” Panya Phaopahol, a noodle seller, told Channel 7 TV.
Job said that while monkeys may be a symbol of the city, having fewer around would improve people’s quality of life and keep the city cleaner. “And I think Lopburi has more to offer than just monkeys.”
Associated Press contributed to this storyBechan Baba has dedicated his life to Varanasi’s Anarwali mosque, where Hindus and Muslims come to pray – despite the historical disputes raging outside
In the heart of Varanasi, where the sacred Ganges meanders by and incense smoke mingles with the faint echoes of prayers from a myriad of temples, Bechan Baba sits at the entrance of the Anarwali mosque. A silent sentinel, the 72-year-old Hindu caretaker leans back on weathered stones that were laid almost 400 years ago.
Bechan has dedicated his working life to the service of this ancient mosque, which represents a sense of unity in a city wrestling with historical disputes.
He picks up a weathered broom and regards the edifice that has been his sanctuary and his duty for more than four decades.
“I’ve been here for 45 years, taking care of this mosque. People from both Hindu and Muslim communities come here, offering prayers and worship,” he says.
“My father used to be here, and after him, I took on the responsibility. I’ve been here since my childhood.”
Varanasi, an ancient city about 500 miles south-east of India’s capital, Delhi, and often considered the nation’s spiritual centre, has been tense in the past few months following a legal dispute between Hindus and Muslims over the ownership of the Gyanvapi mosque, built by Emperor Aurangzeb in the 17th century. A court has ruled that Hindus can worship inside the mosque, after dozens of legal petitions were made claiming it was the site of an ancient Hindu temple.
The controversy is reminiscent of the longstanding and occasionally violent dispute between Hindus and Muslims in the nearby city of Ayodhya over religious rights to the Ram temple, something only resolved by a supreme court judgment in 2019.
For Bechan, the years of religious disputes only further the importance of his role. “What if I am a Hindu? I will continue to serve the mosque. What else will I do?”
“I don’t have anything to do with what is going on there [Gyanvapi]. I live here, and I don’t let anything happen here,” he says.
He points out the neighbouring Gopal temple, emphasising the coexistence of the two places of worship. “There is no environment of hate or anything like that. People from both the Hindu and Muslim communities come here, and there have never been any riots during my time,” he says.

Bechan’s only wish is to serve the mosque until his death.
“I don’t go to my home. My children bring me food in the morning. I stay here throughout the day, finding comfort in this space. My children live at home,” he says.
Visitors to the mosque have increased dramatically under Bechan’s regime. “All the prayers of all five times are held here,” he says. “During my father’s time, there was not so much population and people didn’t come here. But now there are many houses, the population has increased, and a lot of people keep coming here,” he says.
People from different faiths come to the mosque to pray he says, making it a powerful symbol of coexistence in a country riven by religious tensions. “See, the Muslim brothers are coming, and now they will offer their namaz [prayers]. They will go to the shrine. They will offer flowers. Hindus will also pay their respects. Both come and go,” he says.In an ancient walled city in eastern Ethiopia, the animals are fed in return for cleaning up the streets and keeping spirits at bay
The hyenas gather as night settles. The bolder animals come early and lounge around, undisturbed by the loud blare of mosques calling people to prayer. By the time Abbas Yusuf arrives, dozens lurk in the semi-darkness, pacing over shards of splintered bone and broken glass.
Abbas whistles and calls, tossing out a few chunks of meat. Then he beckons over the small group of tourists who have come to watch. They take turns feeding the hyenas from sticks, flinching and giggling as the animals tentatively grab the meat between their jaws and scuttle off.
“No problem, don’t worry,” Abbas says, encouraging a tourist to place the meat-tipped stick in his mouth. “Be like a lion.”
The hyenas pounce on the meat left out for them. Their teeth and jaws are specially adapted for crushing bones
Elsewhere in Ethiopia – and many other regions of sub-Saharan Africa – hyenas are feared and denigrated. News programmes often carry stories of them snatching babies, and in the folklore of the Ethiopian highlands, people with the “evil eye” turn into hyenas at night and attack their neighbours. Across Africa, hyenas and people often clash, particularly as human settlements expand. The large carnivores are known to kill people as well as large numbers of livestock, and are often poisoned and killed in retaliatory attacks. Spotted hyenas, in particular, have such a bad reputation that rehabilitating their image has been cited as a species conservation priority by the IUCN.
Here in Harar, a walled city in eastern Ethiopia, however, their presence is not just accepted but encouraged.
“There is a history of living side by side in peace,” says Ahmed Zekaria, a Harari scholar. “The city is structured to accept them.”

While brown and striped hyenas are classed as “near-threatened”, spotted hyenas are not but their numbers are in decline. As human-wildlife conflict increases and habitats shrink, the question of how communities can live in coexistence with large predators becomes increasingly pressing.
In Harar, the animals act as the city’s garbage-disposal system, entering at night through a series of “hyena doors” built into the walls and eating entrails dumped in the streets. Abbas is a longtime human ally, one of the “hyena men” of the city. He learned his trade from his father, Yusuf, who started tossing scraps to hyenas while feeding his dogs decades ago.

Abbas’s connection with the pack runs deep. He has names for all of them, and while most are too skittish to feed directly from his hand, his favourites regularly come to his home.
“I feed them every night, whether there are tourists or not,” he says.
One of his favourites was an elderly female named Chaltu. A few months ago, she wandered into an office building in the town and was clubbed by the guard. When he heard the news, Abbas commandeered an ambulance and brought her to his farm, where he tried to nurse her back to health.

Unfortunately his efforts were in vain. “She was so special to me. I felt like I had lost a family member,” says Abbas.
Today, his relationship with the hyenas is the town’s biggest attraction, and he charges tourists a fee to join in at feeding time.
Like much of Harar’s Muslim population, Abbas and his father believe hyenas can protect people from mischievous djinn, or spirits.
“The hyenas eat them,” says Yusuf. “Without the hyenas, there would be a lot of djinn playing tricks.”
Adil Abubaker, who sells traditional woven baskets in his shop, says their power to keep djinn at bay “is the main reason we need hyenas in the town”.
Adil leaves the leftovers from his table in the cobbled alley outside his house. “The djinn cannot come if there are hyenas,” says Adil. “We feed the hyenas and in return, they protect us from evil spirits. It is a give-and-take relationship.”
Two symbols of Harar: its fortified walls pierced with five gates dating back to the 16th century, and its hyenas, painted on a stone. The city became a Unesco world heritage site in 2006
In Harari folklore, hyenas also act as mediums that can communicate with the town’s dead saints and transmit messages from the townspeople. This is reflected in the local word for hyena: waraba, or “newsman”.
The origin of these beliefs has been lost. Ahmed, the scholar, speculates that the idea hyenas can eat and spit out djinn could stem from their habit of vomiting undigested bits of bones, hooves and hair.
Anthropologist Marcus Baynes-Rock, author of Among the Bone Eaters: Encounters with Hyenas in Harar, believes the legends formed part of a local pre-Islamic belief system and could have been derived from hyenas’ heightened senses.
“When you observe them, it seems like they are operating in a different world, that they can see things humans can’t see,” says Baynes-Rock, who spent more than a year in Harar studying the relationship between its people and hyenas. “It is easy to extrapolate from that if you live in a world brimming with spirits.”
At nightfall, the hyenas of Harar venture out into the streets in search of food
The relationship was not always peaceful. Centuries ago, there was a famine in the region and hungry hyenas preyed on the infirm and sick, according to legend. After deliberating on a nearby mountain, Harar’s saints struck a pact: the townspeople would feed porridge to the hyenas, who would end the attacks.
This story endures during the annual Islamic celebration of Ashura, when pious people still prepare porridge for hyenas at several shrines outside the town.
Abbas has a special relationship with the hyenas. When there are no tourists to watch the ‘animal show’, he sometimes feeds them in his house
As part of a broader effort to boost tourism, Ethiopia’s government is keen to capitalise on Abbas’s relationship with the hyenas. Currently, he feeds them on a patch of wasteland once used as a rubbish dump. This will be replaced by a $2.5m (£2m) “eco-park”, complete with shops, cafes and a museum, which officials hope will attract more tourists.
Yet Harar’s development could imperil its unique relationship with its hyenas. For centuries the walled old town stood on a hill, surrounded by rolling countryside. Today it is wrapped in the sprawling embrace of the much larger new town, which has blocked off many of the routes once used by hyenas.
“It doesn’t matter how much you encourage them,” says Baynes-Rock, “if there is no room left, the hyenas will just go away.”
A spotted hyena on the lookout for scraps on a night-time prowl through the streets of Harar’s old townAs their military exemption ends, tensions divide the country and threaten to topple Netanyahu’s government
Mea Shearim is the heart of Israel’s ultra-Orthodox community, whose role bitterly divides the country and, some believe, may be the issue that ultimately brings down Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.
The special legal status of the ultra-Orthodox, the Haredim, that has endured as long as the state of Israel, came to an abrupt end on Monday following a supreme court decision that the group would no longer benefit from government subsidies and exemption from military service, as is mandatory for most other Jewish Israelis. It followed a series of delays by the government in presenting a proposal demanded by the court aimed at enhancing the military enlistment of ultra-Orthodox men.
The war in Gaza has brought to a head an unresolved conflict within Israel over the special treatment of the Haredim, an argument about the character of the Jewish state itself. Some in the secular parties in Netanyahu’s fractious rightwing coalition say they will walk out if the government does not carry out the instructions of the attorney general to cut off funding to the community’s religious schools and begin drafting its men.
Haredi representatives and supporters in the coalition, meanwhile, say they will walk out if those instructions are carried out. Either way, the issue threatens to do something the disastrous security failure on 7 October or the bloody morass that followed, failed to do – bring down Netanyahu. Trailing significantly in the polls, it is unlikely he could emerge triumphant from any elections that followed a coalition collapse.
On the crowded streets of this Jerusalem district, a few minutes’ walk from the Old City, there is little sign of concern, however, for the simple reason that many Haredi men strolling through its streets on a recent afternoon were adamant they would not serve – whatever the impact of the court’s ruling.
“I will never enter the army. For us, studying the Torah is everything. We live by the word of God, who is above everything. We will follow the directions of our rabbis,” said Yehuda Cohen, a 19-year-old Mea Shearim resident. “Our community members in the government will fight for us. You see, studying the Torah, especially in these days of conflict, is a way for us to fight the war.”
The exemption policy dates back to shortly after the founding of the state of Israel, when 400 students at yeshivas, Jewish institutions for religious study, were permitted to avoid conscription. But as Haredi populations have increased – to about 12% of the country’s 9m citizens – tens of thousands avoid the military and live on government stipends for religious study. Furthermore, certain groups within the ultra-Orthodox community do not recognise the state of Israel, asserting that the establishment of a nation is contingent upon the arrival of the Messiah.
“The army can come here and say whatever they want,” says Ari, 19. “But we only answer to God. We will not enlist because studying the Torah has always been our only objective. They can fine us or do whatever they want. We will pay the fines, but we will not enter the army.”
Ultra-Orthodox Jews live their life according to religious commandments and distance themselves from modern society. Posters as you enter the district urge women to wear modest clothing and another declares: “If you take your smartphone out in this holy place, it will be confiscated. There are guards everywhere!’’.
Young children roam the streets unaccompanied. Haredi families are large, many with five or six children whom the parents teach from a very young age to be independent.
“There were several attempts over the years to force the Haredim to join the army, and they all failed,” said Yitzik Crombie, a Haredi tech entrepreneur and author. “After 7 October, there is a real need for manpower in the military, but the Haredim will never join the army if they are forced to. I believe this draft law is a mistake and Israeli society will never accept it. If the law passes, people will take the streets. And I’ll be the first one to join them.”
Israeli flags have been set on fire in protests in Mea Shearim in recent years, along with military uniforms.
The Israeli attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, on Sunday wrote to the defence and education ministries to say that the “process of drafting members of the ultra-Orthodox community into the army must begin”, as the court had ordered, and warned “against any attempt to continue funding yeshivahs that harbour students who dodge their army service, against court orders”.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) puts the number of ultra-Orthodox males eligible for military conscription each year at approximately 13,000. Other sources inside the army put it much higher. There are a reported 60,000 yeshiva students between the ages of 18 and 26.
No enlistment has yet begun. An IDF spokesperson said: “The IDF is currently conducting preparations regarding the recruitment of yeshiva members, decisions on this matter will be made in accordance with the law and the guidance of the government.
“The IDF is the army of the nation and works in a professional manner in order to recruit the populations liable for conscription, in accordance with the security service law.”
The war in Gaza has inflamed the long-simmering resentment of the Haredim among other Israelis who have to serve in the IDF. Scores of demonstrators associated with the Brothers in Arms movement, formed of IDF reservists, rallied in Mea Shearim on Sunday demanding the conscription of ultra-Orthodox men.
“I believe, I believe, I believe in enlisting in the military,” the protesters chanted, while some Haredi residents threw eggs, water and bottles at the demonstrators.
“They just want to provoke us,” said Ari.
The two ultra-Orthodox parties in Netanyahu’s religious-nationalist coalition, United Torah Judaism and Shas, have denounced the court’s ruling on removing government subsidies as a “mark of Cain”. Aryeh Deri, the head of Shas, called it “unprecedented bullying of Torah students in the Jewish state”.
Benny Gantz, a political rival of Netanyahu who has declared his willingness to resign from the emergency unity government over the issue, praised the court’s decision and said it recognised “the need for soldiers during a difficult war, and the need for everyone in our society to take part in the right to serve the country”.
Anshel Pfeffer, a political columnist on Haaretz newspaper, argued that threats from the ultra-Orthodox parties to walk out were empty and they were “in no rush to leave this governing coalition” as a centrist alternative would be worse for them.
Other political analysts and politicians, however, believe the issue could be the one that brings down Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. Naama Lazimi, a Knesset member for the centre-left Labor party, said the row could be “a gamechanger”.
Menahem Elison, 19, said he was confident that ultra-Orthodox parties representing his community would find a solution. “I trust our Haredi politicians,” he said. “They know we are not going to enlist in the army. They understand the importance of studying the Torah.”Hosted by Evelyn Miller, narrated by Colleen Prendergast and John Done. Produced by

Several recent polls have suggested that Donald Trump may be on course to receive more support from Black voters than any Republican presidential nominee in history. Some have argued the polling isn’t representative enough.
This week, Jonathan Freedland speaks to the historian and author Leah Wright Rigueur about whether or not Trump can really win over more Black voters than Joe Biden can afford to lose. Or should his main concern be those disaffected voters who don’t turn to Trump, but instead don’t turn out at all, choosing to stay home?

The killing of six international aid workers and their Palestinian driver this week has brought new scrutiny of Israel’s conduct in its war in Gaza. Peter Beaumont and Patrick Wintour examine the growing backlash

They had told the Israelis they were there. Travelling along a coastal road in Gaza, six aid workers – from the UK, Poland, Australia and Canada – and their Palestinian driver. They had just unloaded more than 100 tonnes of humanitarian food aid brought to Gaza for the millions of people at risk of famine when suddenly a drone appeared above them and struck not once but three times. There were no survivors. As Peter Beaumont tells Michael Safi, the strikes on the team from the aid organisation World Central Kitchen have done what 33,000 Palestinians deaths apparently could not and outraged leaders in the UK and around the world. Israel says these strikes were an error, a tragedy, to be independently investigated.
As the Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, explains, the mood at the highest level in the UK has noticeably shifted. Now there is an open debate among senior figures in the legal profession and at the top of politics about whether Britain should continue to arm Israel. Polling of the public suggests more than half of people believe it should stop.

The Scottish government has introduced a hate crime law that broadens protections for marginalised groups but critics say it limits freedom of speech. Libby Brooks reports
How to listen to podcasts: everything you need to know
On Monday, the Scottish government introduced the Hate Crime and Public Order (Scotland) Act. It is intended to consolidate existing hate crime laws, and also creates a new offence of “threatening or abusive behaviour which is intended to stir up hatred” on the grounds of disability, religion, age, sexual orientation, transgender identity and variations in sex characteristics.
Libby Brooks, the Guardian’s Scotland correspondent, tells Hannah Moore what this change to legislation means for marginalised groups and why there have been concerns from the police and critics who worry that the law limits freedom of expression.

Israel has approved the reopening of the Erez crossing into northern Gaza and temporary use of Ashdod port in southern Israel after the US president, Joe Biden, said conditions could be placed on US support for Israel if it did not act.
Global outrage at the humanitarian crisis escalated after an Israeli airstrike killed seven people working for the international charity World Central Kitchen. Noting that 196 humanitarian workers had been killed so far during Israel's campaign, Guterres said: 'We want to know why'

Tesla will reveal its robotaxi product on Aug. 8, CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post on X.
Musk has spoken about the robotaxi project for years, and it could represent a major new business for the carmaker as investors grow wary of the company during a period of slowing growth.
Tesla shares rose over 3% in extended trading after Musk's tweet.
Musk shared the reveal date on Friday after Reuters reported that plans for Tesla's highly anticipated low-cost car model had been scrapped. Musk accused Reuters of "lying."
In 2015, Elon Musk told shareholders that Tesla's cars would achieve "full autonomy" within three years. In 2016, he said Tesla would able to send one of its cars on a cross-country drive without requiring any human intervention by the end of the following year.
Tesla still has yet to deliver a robotaxi, autonomous vehicle or technology that can turn its cars into "level 3" automated vehicles. However, Tesla offers advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), including a standard Autopilot option or premium Full Self-Driving "FSD" option, the latter of which costs $199 per month for U.S. subscribers or $12,000 upfront.
In a push for end-of-quarter sales, Musk recently mandated that all sales and service staff install and demo FSD for customers before handing over the keys. He wrote in an email to employees, "Almost no one actually realizes how well (supervised) FSD actually works. I know this will slow down the delivery process, but it is nonetheless a hard requirement."
Despite its name, Tesla's premium option requires a human driver at the wheel, ready to steer or brake at any moment.
Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit Waymo operates commercial, driverless ride-hailing services in Phoenix, San Francisco and Los Angeles, and is ramping up in Tesla's home base of Austin, Texas. Waymo also recently struck a multi-year partnership with Uber and will put its robotaxis to use delivering food for Uber Eats in Arizona. In China, Didi's autonomous unit operates commercially in markets including Guangzhou. Companies including Wayve in the U.K. and Zoox in the U.S. continue testing their robotaxis.
Some companies have had a tough time in the crowded market.
On Friday, Apple shuttered its self-driving unit and laid off about 600 people on Friday who had been associated with the project. GM's Cruise service previously offered self-driving car services in San Francisco before being wound down under regulatory scrutiny after an accident. Since the incident, Cruise's robotaxi fleet has been grounded, local and federal governments have launched their own investigations and Cruise leadership has been gutted.
At Tesla, "unveil" dates do not predict a near-future date for a commercial release of a new product. For example, Tesla unveiled its fully electric heavy-duty truck, the Semi, in 2017 and did not begin deliveries until December 2022. It still produces and sells very few Semis to this day.
- CNBC's Kif Leswing contributed reporting.CNBC's Jim Cramer on Friday told investors what to look out for next week on Wall Street, highlighting earnings reports from major banks, Delta Air Lines and Constellation Brands.
He also suggested it's not fruitful to obsess about the Federal Reserve's next move.
"Stop worrying about how many rate cuts we're going to get when or where or why or how," he said. "If you can't free yourself from this terrible parlor game, you're going to miss out a ton of terrific investments."
Tuesday, Cramer will be listening to a conference from cannabis company Tilray. The Florida Supreme Court on Monday said it would allow voters to decide whether recreational cannabis can be legalized in the state, which could be a big deal for the industry. Cramer said if investors want to bet on cannabis, they might want to choose Canopy Growth — however, many traders prefer Tilray.
Wednesday brings the consumer price index report, and Cramer said he'll be waiting to see if the numbers are too hot. He'll also be paying attention to earnings from Delta, which he said has the best financials of its peers.
Cramer said Thursday is an important earnings day because Constellation Brands will share its quarterly results. He said he expects a great quarter from the beverage company, which is known for products including Modelo.
Friday is also a big day for earnings, Cramer said, with reports from Wells Fargo, JPMorgan, BlackRock and Citigroup. He cautioned that these names might not perform well when the Fed starts to rate cuts.

Questions, comments, suggestions for the "Mad Money" website? madcap@cnbc.comA man serving a life sentence for kidnapping and other crimes while in a Georgia prison built two bombs which he mailed to a District of Columbia office building and the federal courthouse and building in Anchorage, Alaska, prosecutors allege.
The accused bomb maker, 55-year-old David Cassady, allegedly put the two explosive devices into the mail at his prison in Tattnall County on Jan. 24, 2020, according to an indictment issued by a grand jury in U.S. District Court in Statesboro, Georgia.
The bomb that went to Washington, D.C., was mailed to the Bond Building, whose office tenants include the Department of Justice.
The indictment alleges Cassady made and sent the bombs with the intent to "to maliciously damage or destroy, by means of fire or explosive, a building in whole or in part owned or possessed by, or leased to, the United States," and "created substantial risk of injury to a person."
Neither bomb exploded.
Cassady is charged with one count of making an unregistered destructive device, two counts of mailing a destructive device and two counts of attempted malicious use of an explosive.
"Protecting our personnel and facilities is a fundamental role of our office and of our law enforcement partners," said U.S. Attorney Jill Steinberg, whose office is prosecuting Cassady. "We also will take action against inmates who seek to commit crimes and harm the public from behind bars."
Barry Paschal, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, declined to comment when asked to explain the more than four-year lag between Cassady allegedly mailing the bombs, and being charged in the case.
Paschal said he could not comment on details of the case beyond those contained in the indictment.
That charging document did not say how Cassady allegedly made the bombs while locked up in prison, the size of those devices, how he mailed them from prison, and why he chose the DOJ headquarters and the federal courthouse and building in Anchorage as his targets.
A spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Corrections said, "Cassady was able to manipulate primarily items he was authorized to possess into makeshift explosive devices."
"We appreciate the support of our federal partners in ensuring that justice will be served on this individual for his role in jeopardizing the safe operations of our facilities, and most importantly, the safety of the public," said the spokeswoman, Joan Heath.
Cassady has a long criminal record dating to the late 1980s, when he was sentenced to prison for three years after convictions for six counts of first-degree forgery.
Corrections Department records show he began serving his most recent stint in prison in 1993, after being convicted of kidnapping, aggravated sodomy, impersonating an officer and false imprisonment.
While in prison in Tattnal County, Cassady was convicted of crimes in 2019 including terroristic threats and acts, false statements, gang participation, and conspiracy, records show.The U.S. job market continues to chug ahead without signs of overheating — a good sign for workers and the U.S. economy, according to economists.
While the market has cooled from its breakneck pace of the "great resignation" era, employers are adding ample jobs to their payrolls, unemployment hovers near historical lows, and worker buying power (so-called "real" wage growth) is steadily rising, economists said.
The labor market has been resilient despite economic headwinds like higher interest rates.
"This is still a labor market that's very attractive, especially historically speaking, for workers," said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter.
"There's still strong, broad-based job growth and real wage growth has been restored," Pollak said. "I think that's very, very good news."
Employers added 303,000 jobs to payrolls in March, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday. That's the largest monthly gain since January 2023.
Job growth in the first three months of 2024 — 274,000, on average — beats the 2019 pre-pandemic average by more than 100,000.
The U.S. unemployment rate declined to 3.8% in March, from 3.9% in February. Unemployment has been below 4% — a historically low mark — for more than two years.
"That's an exceptionally long period of such tight labor markets," Pollak said.
Those conditions are pushing employers to make "very attractive" offers to new hires and proactively recruit prospective candidates, she said.
The layoff rate has also been near a historic low for more than two years, as employers hang on to their current workforce.
Additionally, more workers joined the labor force in March, boosting the labor force participation rate at a time when job openings remain historically high. That dynamic suggests a healthy, sustainable equilibrium between the supply and demand of labor, economists said.
"The labor market is settling into a sweet spot," said Nick Bunker, economic research director for North America at job site Indeed.
It's powering ahead and "there's open road ahead of it as well," he said.
Of course, the job market isn't as a hot as it was in 2021 and 2022, after the U.S. economy awoke from a Covid-induced slumber.
At that time, workers were quitting their jobs at the fastest rate in history — a trend dubbed the great resignation — amid ample job opportunity and the relative ease of finding a higher-paying gig.
Workers saw the "red carpet rolled out for them," Pollak said.

But those conditions helped stoke high inflation, which touched a four-decade high in 2022. Fast-rising prices for consumer goods meant workers' rapidly growing wages couldn't keep pace with price tags at the store.
The average worker's buying power fell for two years as a result.
Wage growth has declined, to an annual 4.1% pace in March from a pandemic-era peak of 5.9% in March 2022, on average. But inflation has fallen more than that, which translates to an increase in household buying power since May 2023.
Real hourly earnings — wages after accounting for inflation — grew by 1.1% in February 2024 versus a year earlier.
The current labor market is in many ways more desirable than the red-hot one a few years ago, which wasn't sustainable, economists said.
While workers have lost some leverage, it's still "relatively easy" to find a job and workers are now getting those inflation-adjusted raises, Bunker said.
"There are aspects of the 2021 and 2022 labor market people want back, but aspects of the 2024 labor market people prefer more," Bunker said.
Plus, the Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs to their highest level in over two decades to combat pandemic-era inflation. That pushed interest rates for mortgages, credit cards and other consumer debt sky high.
Fed officials see cooling wage growth is a positive relative to the inflation fight, and may provide comfort they need to start reducing borrowing costs this year, economists said.In this article
It's a timeless question at fast-food counters: Do you want fries with that?
Responders continue answering affirmatively at a higher-than-average rate, a top potato supplier indicated. It underscores the resilience of consumer spending, even as inflation pinches pocketbooks and pandemic savings dry up.
A larger share of customers keep adding the iconic side to meal orders than in the past, according to frozen potato supplier Lamb Weston. Looking at the bigger picture, strength in the so-called fry attachment rate bolsters economic data, showing the willingness of average Americans to still shell out for everyday luxuries.
"The fry attachment rate has stayed pretty consistent," said CEO Thomas Werner during the company's earnings call on Thursday. "It's been above historical levels for the past two, three years."
This is just one example of how consumers keep purchasing despite mounting reasons to tighten purse strings, a phenomenon that's puzzling economists.
Spending on retail and food services in America topped $700 billion in February, according to advance and adjusted government figures. That's about 1.5% higher than the same month a year ago. And it's a whopping 38.5% higher when compared with February 2019.
Rising wages and fiscal stimulus measures padded bank accounts during the early years of the Covid-19 crisis, prompting increased purchasing. But in more recent years, U.S. consumers have felt increasing pressure amid runaway inflation, elevated interest rates and the end of pandemic-era financial benefits.
And experts have been surprised by the unwavering propensity of Americans to use their cash, even as consumer confidence sours and fears of an economic downturn swirl. The choice to add french fries provides one case study of what some have dubbed "YOLO" or "revenge" spending, with the first term named after the acronym for "you only live once."
To be sure, there are signs of financial stress on consumers that impact monetary decisions around food. WK Kellogg CEO Gary Pilnick told CNBC earlier this year that cereal was trending as a dinner alternative while shoppers grappled with higher grocery costs.
Though customers still opt for fries, Werner said Lamb Weston's volume took a hit nonetheless due to softer foot traffic overall in the restaurants it serves. That slide comes as consumers grow accustomed to increased prices for menu items as a result of inflation, the executive said. (Lamb Weston provides potatoes for large chains such as McDonald's and Chick-fil-A, though Werner did not specify which companies are experiencing slowdowns.)
"On the one hand, fries remain as popular as ever with consumers," Werner said. "But on the other hand, consumers are going out to eat less often."
Lamb Weston on Thursday reported adjusted earnings and revenue for the fiscal third quarter that came in below estimates of analysts polled by FactSet. The Idaho-based company's outlook for full-year performance on both financial measures also missed Wall Street forecasts.
Shares tumbled more than 19% in Thursday's session, touching lows not seen in more than a year.

Questions, comments, suggestions for the "Mad Money" website? madcap@cnbc.comThe Walt Disney Company on Friday revealed its new theatrical schedule, which will feature a film about the Mandalorian and Grogu, a fifth "Toy Story" film, and another "Tron" flick before the end of 2026.
The company's theatrical business has struggled in the wake of pandemic shutdowns and dual Hollywood labor strikes, as productions stalled and moviegoers' box-office habits shifted. All the while, Disney struggled to connect with audiences, which further exacerbated revenue woes.
Since returning to the helm at Disney in late 2022, CEO Bob Iger has been working to right the ship. He's admitted that the quality of its films suffered in its bid to pump out a high quantity of entertainment content. He said brands such as Marvel, in particular, needed to be more selective about which sequels get made.
Iger also said he would no longer tolerate his company's partners and creative team prioritizing messaging over storytelling.
Disney's updated slate features several iconic franchises, as well as some releases for adult audiences.
Notably, the company's "Moana" sequel has been pushed to July 2026. It was originally slated to open in 2025.
"The Amateur," a 20th Century Production starring Oscar winner Rami Malek, moved to April 2025 from its previous November 2024 date. And "Nightbitch," a Searchlight feature with Amy Adams attached, will release in December 2024.
Disney teased that one of its 2026 Star Wars films would feature the iconic duo from its Disney+ series "The Mandalorian" and revealed its title will be "The Mandalorian & Grogu." It is slated for theatrical release on May 22, 2026.
A fifth "Toy Story" film is set to hit theaters on June 19, 2026, and "Tron: Ares" is slated for Oct. 10, 2025.In this article
Outgoing Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun's take-home pay fell to $5 million last year after declining a bonus, compared with $7 million in 2022, and his latest compensation package is taking a hit from the prolonged safety crisis surrounding the company's bestselling jetliner, the 737 Max.
Calhoun's total compensation last year rose 45% to $32.8 million, up from $22.6 million in the prior year. But Boeing said the 2023 sum is closer to $23.5 million, as it includes long-term incentives such as stock. Shares of the plane-maker are down almost 30% this year.
Total compensation for Stan Deal, whom Boeing last month replaced at the top of the commercial airplanes division, rose 42% to $12.5 million.
Calhoun last month said he would step down by the end of the year. His departure is part of a broad shake-up in which the company also replaced its chairman and head of its commercial airplane unit. The manufacturer is grappling with the fallout of a door plug panel that blew out midair from a 737 Max operated by Alaska Airlines in January.
Boeing disclosed the take-home pay, which did not include a 2023 bonus Calhoun declined that was valued at $2.8 million, and executive compensation in a filing Friday. The company said it will now more closely tie executive compensation to safety goals.
"I promise that I personally, and we as a Board, will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to get this company where it needs to be," newly named Boeing Chairman Steve Mollenkopf said in a message to shareholders in a filing Friday.
The Jan. 5 accident has slowed deliveries of new jets and Boeing has said it will burn more cash than it previously expected. The company is scheduled to release first-quarter results April 24.
Calhoun took the helm at Boeing in January 2020 after his predecessor was ousted for his handling of the aftermath of two fatal crashes of the 737 Max. In addition to the Covid-19 pandemic's devastating effect on the aviation industry, Boeing has also had a host of quality defects on its aircraft. Those have slowed deliveries of new planes to customers clamoring for fresh jets as travel snapped back, hurting Boeing's cash flow.
The Alaska Airlines door plug near-catastrophe was the most serious issue since the crashes. The Justice Department is investigating the Alaska Airlines accident and the Federal Aviation Administration has capped Boeing's 737 Max production until it signs off on Boeing's quality control.
Boeing said on Friday that "operational performance metrics for all business units will be focused exclusively on quality and safety goals" this year and that long-term executive incentives could be reduced to zero if goals are not met.
Boeing last posted an annual profit in 2018.
Clarification: CEO Dave Calhoun's total 2023 compensation is closer to $23.5 million. An earlier version contained a figure that was later updated by Boeing.The unemployment rate among Black Americans jumped in March, according to data released Friday by the Department of Labor.
Black unemployment rose to 6.4% last month, up from 5.6% in February. That's higher than the overall unemployment rate, which edged lower to 3.8% last month, as well as the 3.4% jobless rate for white Americans, which held steady from February.
When accounting for gender, the unemployment rate for Black women aged 20 or older spiked to 5.6%, a big increase from the 4.4% rate in February. Black men's jobless rates climbed slightly higher to 6.2% from 6.1%.
"That's a concerning trend," said Elise Gould, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
Gould pointed out that the unemployment rate for Black Americans has been steadily increasing since December. "I would say it's not alarming yet, but I think it's something that we really need to watch in coming months," she added.
While March's increase was primarily driven by the surge among Black women, Gould noted that in the past four months, the unemployment rates for both men and women has risen. However, she also cautioned that monthly data for demographic groups can be volatile by nature.
Last month, the labor force participation rate – the percentage of the population that is either employed or actively seeking work – among Black Americans inched lower to 63.6%, down from 63.7% in February.  For Black women, the rate ticked lower to 63% from 63.4%, while it inched down to 69.6% from 69.8% among Black men.
"People are looking for more opportunities, not all of them are getting them, and that's why the unemployment rate is rising," Gould added.
This compares to the overall U.S. labor market participation rate, which rose to 62.7% in March from February's 62.5%.
Black Americans were the demographic group that suffered the most from Covid-induced business shutdowns. The unemployment rate for Black workers peaked at 16.8% in 2020, higher than the overall unemployment rate's April 2020 high of 14.7%.
Hispanic Americans saw their unemployment rate drop to 4.5% from 5% last month. Similarly, Asian unemployment fell to 2.5% from 3.4% in February.

Norfolk Southern is almost two months into a battle with activist investor Ancora, which is trying to shake up the railroad's board and oust CEO Alan Shaw.
Now the firm is taking aim at Norfolk Southern's new operating chief John Orr over what the activist calls an "excessive" buyout package and a career marred by allegations of racial and sexual discrimination.
Last month, Norfolk Southern hired Orr away from rival CPKC, paying tens of millions of dollars to buy him out of his contract. The move was widely seen as a response to Ancora's operational criticisms and received praise from several Wall Street analysts.
In a letter to Norfolk Southern shareholders on Friday, Ancora highlighted past misconduct by Orr that raises questions about his hiring, even as the executive has overseen improvements in the railroad's operations in his three weeks on the job.
Ancora documented both alleged and substantiated workplace misconduct by Orr, dating back to his time as a mid-level executive at Canadian National. An appointee of the Canadian Arbitration Board substantiated allegations that Orr used verbally abusive language toward a female employee in the early 2000s.
The employee and another witness told the employment tribunal at the time that Orr regularly cursed and shouted at the employee, and called her a "f------ b----" and a "f------ idiot." A witness told the arbitrator that, in one instance, Orr told the employee that she "was so f------ stupid it was embarrassing."
The arbitrator found the claims credible.
Ancora also flagged a lawsuit filed in 2019 by a Black executive, who described Orr's treatment of employees and subordinates as "abysmal." The suit was filed against Canadian National, alleging racial discrimination.
Orr's behavior was allegedly "so bad" that Canadian National was forced to provide executive coaching for him, according to a 2020 filing in the lawsuit. Orr's deposition is sealed and the case was settled in 2022.
Prior to the announced hiring of Orr, Ancora drew attention to claims about his behavior in emails to two Norfolk Southern board members that CNBC obtained.
Ancora said in its statement on Friday that the hiring of Orr was a costly proposition that's harming shareholders. As part of the agreement, Norfolk Southern said it would pay Orr's prior employer $25 million in cash and provide additional unspecified concessions for a key rail hub and route in the southern U.S. Norfolk Southern values that particular part of the route at around 1% of its revenues.
When it announced Orr's hiring, Norfolk Southern didn't disclose the initial impact of the concessions or the estimated knock-on effects in the years to come.
Norfolk Southern told CNBC in a statement that Ancora's analysis of the value of the route — the Meridian Speedway agreement — "is completely inaccurate and based on a flawed premise," in that it assumes Norfolk Southern is forgoing more revenue than it actually is.
"As we previously stated, this revised agreement is by no means a consequential concession," the company said.
Ancora is seeking to oust Norfolk Southern's Shaw along with Orr in favor of former UPS CEO Jim Barber and former CSX Executive Vice President Jamie Boychuk, respectively. The activist has said that Norfolk Southern is dramatically underperforming its peers, and has laid the blame at the feet of Shaw and the board.
Regarding Orr, Norfolk Southern said he has a "track record of improving performance while operating safely and with integrity."
"Ancora's attempt to malign John by dredging up claims against his former employer, one of which is from over 20 years ago, is nothing more than an attempt to distract from the facts about their deeply flawed COO candidate, Jamie Boychuk," a company spokesperson told CNBC. "Mr. Orr and Mr. Boychuk's track records and industry reputations are simply not comparable."
In February 2023, a Norfolk Southern freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, releasing toxic chemicals into the environment and prompting a political fight regarding railroad safety. Since then, the stock is roughly flat while the S&P 500 is up 26%.
Norfolk Southern's shareholders meeting is scheduled for May 9.
Ancora has gained the backing of other stakeholders in its fight with the company. Neuberger Berman, which holds a small position in Norfolk Southern, said on Friday that it would support Ancora's slate, citing a "history of poor governance that has long preceded" the railroad's transformation efforts.
A settlement between the two sides appears unlikely, Gordon Haskett analyst Don Bilson said in a Friday note to clients. Shaw previously told CNBC that the company offered Ancora a "couple" of board seats in a settlement offer.
Ancora told CNBC that it's made repeated attempts to settle with the company, both directly and through advisors. Any settlement, from Ancora's perspective, would be contingent on a board refresh and Shaw's ouster. The board has repeatedly expressed confidence in Shaw and has said it isn't interested in a settlement that would lead to his departure.

The mammoth integration of failed bank Credit Suisse into its former rival UBS will act as a "case study," UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti said Friday, one that will show that big bank mergers should be allowed.
"It's going to be a case study to be evaluated globally, but also particularly in Europe, where eventually the necessity of creating stronger banks, and stronger and more competitive banks from a global standpoint of view, is in my point of view a necessity," Ermotti told CNBC's Steve Sedgwick at an event at the Ambrosetti Spring Forum in Italy.
"Of course, we can't just rely on a crisis to create or facilitate the merger of banks," Ermotti said.
"It's good to have strong players that can be part of the solution, like UBS was in the Credit Suisse case. ... But it cannot be just that part. So in that sense, I think that the real issue is, there has to be a political desire to facilitate something like that. So it's not the reality of today," he added.
Credit Suisse collapsed in March 2023 after years of underperformance, scandals and risk management crises. UBS in June completed its takeover of the 167-year-old bank in a deal controversially brokered by Swiss authorities.
The Swiss National Bank has said the size of the new entity flags potential competition issues that will need to be monitored.
Ermotti said Friday, "The good news is that, in my view, in many countries, there is a recognition that they want to protect their banks or financial institutions as national champions, which is an implied or explicit recognition of their value for their economies."
"But the bad news is that they don't realize that in order to really be meaningful, and go to the next level of their contribution in their economies, they will need to be also more competitive globally. But without a banking union, without a capital markets union, it's going to be very, very difficult for Europe to compete with U.S. large banks."
Unlike in the U.S., European economies continue to rely on the banking sector for business financing; and Europe has a "completely different playing field and a lack of critical mass," Ermotti said.
"So I hope, I'm not so convinced it's going to happen soon, but I hope eventually one day those kinds of mergers between big banks will be allowed and we can contribute to that by showing that it's possible. In the meantime, I think that in many countries, critical mass and synergies can be created by further rounds of local mergers," he said.Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman said Friday that it's possible interest rates may have to move higher to control inflation, rather than the cuts her fellow officials have indicated are likely and that the market is expecting.
Noting a number of potential upside risks to inflation, Bowman said policymakers need to be careful not to ease policy too quickly.
"While it is not my baseline outlook, I continue to see the risk that at a future meeting we may need to increase the policy rate further should progress on inflation stall or even reverse," she said in prepared remarks for a speech to a group of Fed watchers in New York. "Reducing our policy rate too soon or too quickly could result in a rebound in inflation, requiring further future policy rate increases to return inflation to 2 percent over the longer run."
As a member of the Board of Governors, Bowman is a permanent voting member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. Since taking office in late 2018, her public speeches have put her on the more hawkish side of the FOMC, meaning she favors a more aggressive posture toward containing inflation.
Bowman said her most likely outcome remains that "it will eventually become appropriate to lower" rates, though she noted that "we are still not yet at the point" of cutting as "I continue to see a number of upside risks to inflation."
The speech, to the Shadow Open Market Committee, comes with markets on edge about the near-term future of Fed policy. Statements this week from multiple officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have indicated a cautious approach to cutting rates. Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, an FOMC voter, told CNBC he likely sees just one reduction this year, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari indicated no cuts could happen if inflation does not decelerate further.
Futures traders are pricing in three cuts this year, though it has become a close call between June and July for when they start. FOMC members in March also penciled in three cuts this year, though one unidentified official in the "dot plot" indicated no decreases until 2026 and there was considerable dispersion otherwise about how aggressively the central bank would move.
"Given the risks and uncertainties regarding my economic outlook, I will continue to watch the data closely as I assess the appropriate path of monetary policy, and I will remain cautious in my approach to considering future changes in the stance of policy," Bowman said.
Weighing inflation risks, she said that supply-side improvements that helped bring numbers down this year may not have the same impact going forward. Moreover, she cited geopolitical risks and fiscal stimulus as other upside hazards, along with stubbornly higher housing prices and labor market tightness.
"Inflation readings over the past two months suggest progress may be uneven or slower going forward, especially for core services," Bowman said.
Fed officials will get their next look at inflation data Wednesday, when the Labor Department releases the March consumer price index report.The Powerball jackpot hit $1.3 billion on Friday — the game's fourth-largest prize.

U.S. lottery sales exceeded $113.3 billion in 2023, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries.
With varying state and provincial regulations, players have different purchase options, such as in-person or online sales, depending on where they live.
One option is lottery-courier services, which accept orders and buy lottery tickets on a customer's behalf.
"Lottery couriers are still relatively new," said Mike Silveira, chief of staff for Jackpot.com, which provides digital lottery-courier services. "This has to be one of the last consumer-facing industries to shift online."
Players can use Jackpot.com to order state lottery tickets via mobile phone, tablet or computer. The company buys the ticket on behalf of customers and scans an image of the ticket directly into the app.
As of April 5, Jackpot.com operated in five states: Arkansas, Ohio, Massachusetts, New York and Texas. But the company expects to see more state approvals, Silveira said.
DraftKings in February acquired Jackpocket, another lottery app, which operates in more than a dozen states.
While ticket purchases now have digital options from state lotteries and third-party companies, most players still buy lottery tickets in person, according to Drew Svitko, executive director of the Pennsylvania Lottery.
He said the state has roughly $5 billion of in-person lottery sales yearly across 10,000 retailers and about $1 billion in online sales.
However, the Pennsylvania Lottery's app has boosted brick-and-mortar sales by "reaching a new audience," Svitko said.
The latest Powerball jackpot comes roughly one week after a single ticket purchased in New Jersey won Mega Millions' fifth-largest grand prize of $1.128 billion.
That grand prize is back down to $67 million and the chances of winning are roughly 1 in 302 million.
